{"headline": "Marriott Cuts Profit Forecast as Demand Weakens Overseas", "article": "Marriott International Inc. (MAR) , the largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, cut its full-year profit forecast after reporting second-quarter results that were in line with analysts’ estimates. The company expects earnings per share for the third quarter of 42 cents to 46 cents, less than the 49-cent average of 29 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Marriott projected full-year earnings of $1.92 to $2.03 a share, which would miss both the $2.04 that analysts are estimating and the company’s own previous guidance of $1.93 to $2.08. Slowing demand from business groups and U.S. government cutbacks in travel spending weighed on Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott’s second-quarter earnings, while weakening hotel use abroad may hamper results for the rest of the year, according to Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson. “Looking at group business, we remain encouraged in terms of long-term bookings, but short-term group business weakened in the U.S. as the quarter progressed,” Sorenson said on a conference call with investors. “Our large convention hotels and our hotels in Washington and Boston were particularly impacted as group demand weakened.” The company is “still experiencing a lingering effect from the recession” and is taking a “more conservative view” of demand trends for Asia and the Middle East, Sorensen said. Revpar Growth Second-quarter earnings of 57 cents a share matched the average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose to $179 million from $143 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement. Revenue per available room, an industry measure of occupancies and rates, climbed 5.3 percent from a year earlier at company-operated hotels in North America. Worldwide, revpar increased 4.7 percent, according to the statement. Marriott in May projected second-quarter earnings of 55 cents to 59 cents a share and said it expected revpar to increase 5 percent to 7 percent in North America, 2 percent to 4 percent outside North America and 4 percent to 6 percent worldwide. “International revenue growth has been quite tepid,” Nikhil Bhalla, an analyst at FBR & Co. (FBRC) in Arlington, Virginia, said after the earnings were announced. “Softening demand in Europe and Asia will weigh on them for the remainder of the year.” Total revenue rose to $3.26 billion in the second quarter from $2.78 billion a year earlier. Starwood, Hyatt Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) , owner of the luxury St. Regis and W brands, last week said second-quarter earnings climbed 12 percent, helped by cost cuts and sales of vacation units at the company’s South Florida resort. Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain controlled by the Pritzker family, yesterday said its second-quarter profit almost tripled as demand climbed at its U.S. properties. Marriott rose 0.2 percent to $41.58 in New York trading.

{"headline": "Sulfurcell Seeks Strategic Partner to Increase Solar Capacity", "article": "Sulfurcell Solartechnik GmbH , a Berlin-based manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, is seeking a strategic partner to help it expand production capacity by more than seven-fold. The company has raised 150 million euros ($205 million), including about 30 million euros in government incentives, Kalman Kaufman, chairman of the supervisory board, said in a Tel Aviv interview at a Landmark Ventures business conference yesterday. “To be really efficient you need hundreds of megawatts,” Kaufman said. A potential partner can be found \"probably in the Far East where the cost of labor is lower and there is more capital in this area.’’ Sulfurcell is planning to expand to between 200 and 300 megawatts of annual production from 40 megawatts in 2011, he said. About 1,700 megawatts in thin-film panels were produced in 2010, a majority of which were by U.S. manufacturer First Solar Inc ., Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated. Thin-film, developed as a cheaper alternative to the traditional solar panels from silicon, uses photovoltaic materials that are deposited in sheets onto surfaces such as for roof shingles or building blocks.

{"headline": "Solvay Second-Quarter Profit Tops Estimates as Prices Gain", "article": "Solvay SA (SOLB) , the world’s largest soda- ash maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates as price increases and rising demand for some products compensated for higher energy costs. Net income more than doubled to 111 million euros ($160 million) from 44 million euros a year earlier, the Brussels- based company said today in a statement. Profit topped the 100.3 million-euro average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Solvay said it raised prices for products including soda ash, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride and specialty polymers by 11 percent. The volume sold increased 4 percent after Solvay removed bottlenecks to expand production capacity for specialty polymers. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and special items rose 12 percent to 304 million euros and were unchanged as a proportion of revenue, at 18 percent. The manufacturer confirmed the earnings figures after highlights of a statement scheduled to be published July 28 were accidentally posted on Solvay’s website at 3:27 p.m. local time and subsequently removed. The soda-ash maker will publish full earnings as planned before the start of trading on July 28. Solvay gained 2.5 percent to 110.75 euros at the 5:40 p.m. close of trading on Euronext Brussels, extending the shares’ advance this year to 39 percent. Today’s increase was the biggest on the 23-company Stoxx 600 Chemicals Index.

{"headline": "Evolution Says It May Consider an Offer for Rival Brokerage Panmure Gordon", "article": "Evolution Group Plc, a London-based stockbroker, said it’s considering an offer for smaller rival Panmure Gordon & Co. The company is “keen to assess Panmure Gordon’s upcoming trading results before determining whether there is any merit in taking its deliberations further,” London-based Evolution said in a statement today. “No formal discussions have taken place between management of the company and Panmure Gordon.” U.K. brokers are seeking to consolidate after the credit crisis cut off financing for takeovers, hurting revenue from advising on fundraisings and mergers. Panmure, which has about 64 corporate clients, said in March its net loss shrank to 11.1 million pounds ($17.4 million) in 2009. A purchase would follow broker Execution Holdings Ltd.’s December takeover of Noble Group Holdings Ltd. Panmure Gordon said in a separate statement that it hasn’t held talks with Evolution. The broker also said the first half “represented particularly challenging markets” though it “expects a bias in revenues towards the second half.” Panmure Gordon gained 8.6 percent to 31.5 pence in London, giving it a market value of about 45.7 million pounds ($71.8 million). Evolution fell 0.6 percent to 85.25 pence, paring its market value to about 198 million pounds. QInvest LLC, a Qatari investment bank, owns about 44 percent of Panmure.

{"headline": "Saudi Banks Among World’s Most Profitable on Prudent Strategies", "article": "Saudi Arabia ’s commercial banking industry continues to be one of the world’s most profitable as high oil prices and vast government spending help lenders pursue prudent strategies, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services said. “Through a unique combination of supportive features, the Saudi banks we rate continue to demonstrate their ability to generate solid, sustainable core earnings, in turn fuelling high profits,” analyst Nicolas Hardy said in an e-mailed statement today. “Prospects for sound earnings and profits are bright.” Saudi bank lending had slowed in the previous two years after two family-owned businesses defaulted on at least $15.7 billion of loans and the economy was hurt by the global credit crunch. High oil prices and vast spending plans under the aegis of the Saudi government have driven the banks’ performance, along with low cost of funding, good pricing power high efficiency and a tax-free environment, according to the statement. The Saudi Monetary Agency has led the banks to revise their strategies in “favor of plain vanilla domestic banking activities, and to strengthen their risk management practices,” S&P said. “They have allocated their robust operating revenues both to build up capital positions and to increase provisions for coverage of bad loans to conservative levels above 100 percent,” it said.

{"headline": "VW Brings Phaeton Flop Back to U.S. as Passat Sedan Fades", "article": "Volkswagen AG (VOW) plans to bring back the Phaeton luxury sedan to the U.S. as the carmaker looks to reignite flagging growth in one of the few markets it has been unable to crack. The Phaeton, the brand’s most expensive model, could be shown to U.S. consumers in January as VW prepares the car’s return after pulling it seven years ago because of weak sales. The reintroduction, which would complement the rollout of new sport-utility vehicles, is aimed at showing off VW’s engineering prowess as the lift from the mainstream Passat sedan fades. “A brand as large as Volkswagen needs a halo project in the upscale segment,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn told Bloomberg at a conference in the company’s hometown of Wolfsburg earlier this month, confirming that the Phaeton will return to U.S. showrooms. “We’ve seen what happens to brands that don’t have that kind of project.” The Phaeton, a pet project of VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech , last year sold about half the volume worldwide that the company initially targeted. Its U.S. comeback is part of a plan to spend $5 billion over the next three years to roll out new models and boost sales in the U.S., where deliveries have started to slip after a two-year burst following the 2011 rollout of the Passat and Jetta sedans that were redesigned for American tastes. Audi Underpinnings The Crossblue concept, a seven-seat sport-utility vehicle that would compete with the Ford (F) Explorer and Toyota Highlander, was shown at the Detroit car show this year. It’s intended to be a big seller alongside the Tennessee-made Passat. The U.S. push is critical to VW’s strategy to surpass General Motors Co. (GM) and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) in global deliveries by 2018. A new version of the Phaeton may be presented at the Detroit auto show in January to test the response for an eventual rollout, three people familiar with the matter said. The car would share underpinnings with the Audi A8 sedan and a hybrid version is planned, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. At its current pace, the company will come up well short of its target of selling 800,000 vehicles in the U.S. by 2018. IHS Automotive predicts deliveries of 517,000 vehicles to American consumers in five years, missing the target by 35 percent. The company has been losing ground this year. VW’s sales in the U.S. fell 0.9 percent to 206,792 cars in the first six months of 2013, while total light vehicle sales in the country rose 7.7 percent. ‘Give Gas’ Volkswagen shares rose 1.4 percent to 169.65 euros today in Frankfurt trading. The gain trimmed the stock’s decline to 1.5 percent this year, valuing the company at 77 billion euros. The Jetta, Beetle and Passat models, which fueled VW’s gains over the past two years, “reached maturity in terms of their sales cycles,” said Tim Urquhart, a London-based analyst at IHS Automotive. The Crossblue SUV should revive growth, while the Phaeton may offer little help, he said. To reinvigorate growth, CEO Winterkorn traveled to Washington last week to show off new models to more than 500 dealers and “motivate them to give gas again,” the executive said. Still, the return of the Phaeton could jar Volkswagen’s recent U.S. strategy of appealing to mid-market buyers. The company made the Passat bigger and cheaper than the European version to appeal to U.S. drivers. The Phaeton started at $66,700 before VW withdrew it. In Germany , the car starts at 70,000 euros ($92,100). Those prices would likely mean the Phaeton would cost more than Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Equus, which starts at $59,250. It could also rival the $75,100 A8 from VW’s Audi unit. Piech Project The return of the Phaeton “would be a bad decision,” said Jesse Toprak , an analyst for TrueCar Inc., which tracks U.S. auto sales. “No one spends $80,000 on a Volkswagen. The company already has luxury brands that can cater to that segment,” such as Audi. The 2006 withdrawal of the Phaeton from the world’s largest market for upscale vehicles was a move by Wolfgang Bernhard , the head of the VW brand at the time, to stem losses in the region. The decision helped trigger his departure because the move called into question Chairman Piech’s strategy. The Phaeton was started by Piech while he was CEO, including the construction of a $238 million glass-walled factory in Dresden. The plant has become one of the city’s top tourist sites alongside the Semperoper opera house, attracting about 90,000 visitors a year. White Robes Production areas have parquet floors with workers wearing white robes -- sometimes even white gloves -- as they assemble cars by hand. The factory’s most eye-catching building is a 40-meter (131-foot) glass tower where finished Phaetons are parked prior to delivery. VW has already sought to reintroduce the Phaeton to the U.S. public. In May, the New York Philharmonic played a concert at the Dresden factory. A raw body frame of a Phaeton dangled above the stage, the gray aluminum illuminated by a soft blue light. The performance featured percussionists clanging 43 body parts of the car as part of a special arrangement of Finnish composer Magnus Lindberg’s Kraft (German for “power”). In the U.S., VW’s narrow lineup has cost it customers like David Smith. The former Golf and Jetta driver wanted a bigger car for his teenage son and two dogs and opted for Toyota Highlander in 2011 after considering VW’s Routan minivan. He’s in the market for a second car and would switch back to VW if the brand had the right car. The Phaeton might be stretching it. “When I was a kid, VW was always an affordable car, and that’s what it should be,” he said.

{"headline": "Strengthen Your Workforce Through Volunteer Programs", "article": "Time-crunched employees are increasingly looking to their jobs to provide opportunities for the good deeds that they don't have the hours for outside of work, and companies are responding. But karmic satisfaction is only part of the payoff. Volunteering offers participants the opportunity to strengthen their skills, broaden their networks, break out of a career rut, and find new meaning in their job. All these benefits redound to employers in the form of increased engagement and retention. Data from the Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) shows that the vast majority of college graduates want to amplify their commitment to good causes through their employer. According to the Deloitte Volunteer Impact Survey (PDF) , Generation Ys who frequently participate in their company's volunteer activities are more likely to be very proud to work for their company, feel very loyal, and are very satisfied with the progression of their careers. In fact, for many recent college graduates, a robust corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandate makes a crucial difference in where they choose to work, with 77% of respondents in a recent study (PDF) indicating that \"a company's commitment to social issues is important when I decide where to work.\" These sentiments hold true across generational cohorts. CTI data finds that 91% of Gen X women and 76% of Gen X men , and 90% of female and 79% of male Baby Boomers , feel it is important to contribute to their community or the wider world through work. Corporate volunteer programs range from one-day community service activities to mini-sabbaticals that send top performers to developing countries to lend their expertise to nonprofit organizations and proven entrepreneurs. Moody's Afternoon of Service is a good example of a once-a-year opportunity for people who want to dip their toes into volunteering. The program takes place during the workday; employees sign up for a variety of team-based activities, including sorting library books at a public school in a poor neighborhood, planting flower bulbs in a city park, lending a hand at an organization that gathers clothing for and coaches disadvantaged women going out on job interviews, and preparing lunch at a community soup kitchen. Fran Laserson, President of the Moody's Foundation, remembers the overwhelming response to this program, which was launched in 2008. \"We're a quantitatively focused company,\" she says. \"Our culture is not effusive or emotional. This is a group of people who rarely say 'very,' yet close to 100% said they found the activity to be rewarding or very rewarding.\" And 67% built relationships with colleagues they didn't usually work with. After the event, 51% felt better about the company, and 50% felt better about themselves. Originally offered to just a few departments, the program is now company-wide, with more than half of all employees participating in 2011. For people who crave a bigger challenge, at least 27 Fortune 500 companies — including Dow Corning, Intel, PepsiCo, FedEx, IBM, and Pfizer — now operate pro bono programs in emerging economies such as India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Ghana, according to a survey by CDC Development Solutions. Such initiatives give employees a chance to develop new skills, the company an opportunity to scope out new business in emerging markets, and the local organization the benefits of corporate expertise and relationships. (By the way, although referred to as \"volunteer\" posts, employees usually receive their regular salaries during their stints of service.) Ernst & Young, for example, sends participants in its Corporate Social Responsibility Fellows program to Central and South America for three months to do the same work they've been doing in their home offices but for much smaller companies. By helping local entrepreneurs with their most pressing business problems — typically providing help that they couldn't otherwise afford — Ernst & Young hopes to bolster their business and build relationships in these growing markets. Recent projects included developing a human resource strategy for a business in Uruguay that provides road accident prevention and risk management services, and organizing the financial records for a Chilean company that makes reusable shopping bags. Such volunteer assignments can do more than inject excitement into a humdrum job; they can ignite a career. Like being tapped for a high-potential development track, getting accepted for a volunteer stint is super-competitive — Intel, for example, says that only 5% of applicants win spots in its Education Service Corps. It's also high-profile, with blogs and videos of participants' experiences distributed throughout the company and on the internet. Who knows what kind of connections could result? In short, corporate volunteer programs deliver more than a karmic paycheck. By providing a practical bonus for both participants and employers, they're not just a \"nice to have\" perk but a retention tool, leadership development opportunity, and strategic business initiative.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "기업의 자원봉사 프로그램이 직원들의 경력 개발에 어떤 도움을 줄 수 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "기업의 사회적 책임(CSR) 활동이 직원들의 회사에 대한 충성도와 만족도에 어떤 영향을 미치나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "기업의 자원봉사 프로그램이 기업의 장기적인 비즈니스 전략에 어떤 기여를 할 수 있나요?"}]}
{"headline": "Donald Payne, N.J.’s First Black Congressman, Dies at 77 of Colon Cancer", "article": "Donald Payne, New Jersey ’s first and so far only black congressman and a leading advocate for democracy in Africa during 23 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, has died. He was 77. He died today at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, of complications from colon cancer, his office said. The senior member of New Jersey’s House delegation, Payne represented the 10th congressional district, which includes parts of Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth, the state’s urban core across the Hudson River from New York City , as well as suburbs including Maplewood and Millburn. He was a longtime member of House committees that oversee education and foreign affairs, and a former chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on Africa. President Barack Obama , speaking at the end of a White House news conference, said Payne “was a wonderful man who did great work both domestically and internationally.” In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie planned to order flags lowered in honor of Payne, according to his spokesman, Michael Drewniak. “He was a great role model for every person in New Jersey who aspires to public service,” Christie said in a statement. “He was a true gentleman and we considered him a friend.” On one of his many trips to the African continent, a 2009 visit to Somalia after a U.S. advisory against Americans visiting there, Payne narrowly escaped a mortar attack in the capital, Mogadishu. Islamist insurgents took responsibility for the attack on the Mogadishu airport as Payne was leaving. Trip With Clinton An earlier trip to Africa was a 12-day tour with President Bill Clinton in 1998 to Ghana , Uganda , Rwanda , South Africa , Botswana and Senegal. Upon his return, Payne told the Associated Press that he hoped the coverage of the trip would give Americans a new awareness and appreciation of African countries that were making strides toward democracy. “The only images during the past decade have been those of strife, disease, conflict, dictators, children starving,” he said. “So for the first time, America had an opportunity to see a balanced picture of Africa.” In 2004, Congress passed a resolution introduced by Payne describing the killings in the Darfur region of Sudan as “genocide,” the first time Congress had applied the term to an ongoing massacre, the New Yorker magazine reported. Payne was a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , and he led the group’s nonprofit foundation. ‘Earned Respect’ House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the congressman “earned respect around the world for his outspoken advocacy on behalf of human rights and the worth and dignity of every person,” according to a statement released by her office. Payne faced little competition in his strongly Democratic district, winning his last general election, in 2010, with 85 percent of the vote. Those seeking to run for the seat left vacant by Payne’s death must register to run in the state’s primary election by the April 2 deadline, according to New Jersey’s Division of Elections. The primary is scheduled for June 5. Donald Milford Payne was born on July 16, 1934, in Newark to William Evander Payne and the former Norma Garrett, according to “Black Americans in Congress,” a House publication. They lived in the Doodletown neighborhood of the city’s predominantly Italian-American North Ward, according to a 1988 New York Times story. His father worked as a chauffeur for families in East Orange and as a lumber handler for Weyerhaeuser on the waterfront. ‘Sense of Neighborhood’ “Everyone, whites and blacks, worked for low wages, although we didn’t think of it as living in poverty, and there was a real sense of neighborhood, of depending on one another,” he told the Times. Payne earned a bachelor’s degree from Seton Hall University in neighboring South Orange in 1957 and married the former Hazel Johnson in 1958, according to the House publication. She died in 1963. He worked as a public-school teacher, an executive at Prudential Insurance Co. and vice president of Urban Data Systems Inc., both based in Newark. The latter company, where he was employed when he was elected to Congress, was started by his brother, William, and made computer forms, according to the Times. From 1970 to 1973 he served as the first black president of the National Council of YMCAs, and he was a member of the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1972 to 1978. From 1973 to 1981 he was chairman of the World YMCA Refugee and Rehabilitation Committee, a job that took him to 80 countries, according to the Times. He served on Newark’s city council from 1982 to 1988. Challenged Rodino In 1980 and 1986, Payne waged unsuccessful primary challenges to Newark’s longtime Democratic congressman, Peter Rodino. Known nationally as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon , Rodino retired in 1988. Payne ran for the seat that year and won. “Nothing is as powerful as a dream whose time has come,” he told the Times after the election. Payne and his wife had three children including Donald M. Payne Jr., president of the Newark Municipal Council.

{"headline": "Spain Raises Tobacco Tax, Sets Date for Pension Overhaul to Stem Contagion", "article": "Spain’s Cabinet raised tax on tobacco and set a date for a pension overhaul as the Socialist government tried to stem contagion from the Irish crisis that sent its bond yields to the highest in a decade. The Cabinet passed an increase in the tax, which will raise 780 million euros ($1 billion), and pledged to send a pension bill to Parliament on Jan. 28, Finance Minister Elena Salgado said today after a weekly meeting. It also approved measures announced Dec. 1 including the sale of stakes in the lottery and airports operator, and a reduction in taxes on small- and mid- sized companies. The government will let an unemployment subsidy that was created a year ago expire in February. Spain’s government, which as recently as last week said it didn’t need to take new measures to convince investors it would meet its budget goals, announced the asset sales after Spanish 10-year bonds slid the most in the euro’s lifetime. The government already slashed public wages and froze pensions at the height of the Greek crisis in May, eroding support for Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , who had made welfare a priority since coming to power in 2004. “Time has run out; we have been talking for months,” Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told a news conference in Madrid. “We are going to work even harder to reach agreements.” Overhaul Delayed The planned pension overhaul, which includes an increase in the retirement age to 67 years from 65 years, was first announced in January and has been delayed as the government waited for a parliamentary committee to present a report on the proposed changes. Unions, once Zapatero’s allies, oppose the changes and the main opposition People’s Party has also criticized the plans. The extra yield on Spanish 10-year bonds fell to 218 basis points today from 226 basis points yesterday. It reached 298 basis points on Nov. 30, the highest since the start of the euro, after European finance chiefs agreed to bail out Ireland and open the door to possible debt restructurings in future crises. The tobacco-tax increase will also help the finances of regional governments, which are suffering from a slump in the real-estate taxes that funded them during Spain’s housing boom. The regional administrations receive 58 percent of the tobacco levy’s proceeds, with the rest going to the central government. Regional Deficits With a combined 104.8 billion euros of outstanding debt and control over health and education spending, the regions are trying to rein in their deficits as part of the national plan to cut the overall public shortfall to 6 percent of gross domestic product next year from 11 percent in 2009. The so-called specific tax rate rises to 12.70 euros per 1,000 cigarettes from 10.20 euros, which is added to a tax of 57 percent of the sale price. The minimum tax resulting from those two levies will now be 116.90 euros per 1,000 cigarettes, compared with a previous 91.30 euros, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. Salgado also said the airport operator, Aena Aeropuertos, will remain a public company, with private investors able to buy only minority stakes. Under the new law, Spain’s 47 individual airports can be managed either as units of Aena Aeropuertos or via private-sector concessions. Subsidy Axed The unemployment subsidy set to be scrapped in February was introduced in August 2009, and more than 200,000 people benefited from it in September this year, according to data from the Labor Ministry. The 426 euro-per-month payment is for unemployed workers who have come to the end of their contributions-based benefits, which last a maximum of two years. There are 1.29 million homes in Spain in which no one is earning, according to the National Statistics Institute, as the economy struggles to recover from an almost two-year recession that pushed the jobless rate to more than 20 percent. Spending cuts and the highest jobless rate in Europe have dented support for the government. The Socialist Party was defeated in regional elections in Catalonia on Nov. 28, and nationwide the opposition People’s Party has a 7.5 percentage- point lead over the Socialists, according to a poll published by Cadena Ser on Nov. 2. The government is aiming for tax cuts for small and mid- sized companies to help spur job creation and growth after the economy stalled in the third quarter. Gross domestic product will contract 0.3 percent this year and expand 1.3 percent in 2011, according to the government’s forecasts. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development sees a 0.2 percent contraction this year and 0.9 percent growth in 2011.

{"headline": "Loyola Meets Maryland in Search of First Men’s Lacrosse Title", "article": "Top-seeded Loyola University Maryland will play the University of Maryland as it seeks its first national men’s college lacrosse championship title. Loyola’s Greyhounds defeated Notre Dame 7-5 and Maryland’s Terps upset third-seeded Duke 16-10 in their National Collegiate Athletic Association semifinals to reach tomorrow’s final at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Greyhounds are making their first final appearance since 1990 when coach Charlie Toomey, then a goalie, and volunteer coach Steve Vaikness were on the team. “Steve Vaikness and I room together. Steve Vaikness and I ride the bus next to each other,” Toomey told reporters. “All we ever wanted was for these guys to have the same feeling that we had 22 years ago. And that’s what they have right now.” Loyola lost to Syracuse 21-9 in 1990 in a game marred by the ineligibility of Syracuse’s Paul Gait. After the championship, the NCAA ruled that it would not recognize Syracuse and coach Roy Simmons Jr.’s 3-0 record, and Gait’s seven goals and seven assists. In yesterday’s semifinal, Eric Lusby scored five goals for a total of 13 goals in the playoffs for the Greyhounds, who are ranked fourth in the country in offense. Westy Hopkins contributed two goals for Notre Dame. Maryland has now reached the final 11 times, winning the championship in 1973 and 1975. “Everyone has rededicated themselves,” said coach John Tillman, who has taken the Terps to the finals in his first two seasons with the team. “Everyone has stepped up.” Last year, Maryland lost to seventh-seeded Syracuse 9-7 in the championship game. Yesterday, Drew Snider scored four goals and Owen Blye had three for the Terps, who return again as an unseeded opponent. Justin Turri and Robert Rotanz each scored two goals for Duke’s Blue Devils. Syracuse University and Northwestern University will meet today in the women’s college lacrosse national championship game at LaValle Stadium in Stony Brook , New York.

{"headline": "China Researcher Calls for Easing Monetary Policy, Hexun Says", "article": "China’s economic growth may slump to 7 percent if the government doesn’t ease monetary policy immediately, a researcher affiliated with the nation’s top economic planning agency said in an interview with Hexun.com. Expansion may drop to about 7 percent by the first quarter of next year and may dip even lower if the world economy deteriorates, Wang Jian , secretary-general of the China Society of Macroeconomics, affiliated to the National Development and Reform Commission, said in an interview with the news website. “We’ve come to the turning point in macroeconomic policy where we need to shift to protecting growth from combating inflation,” Wang said, according to a transcript posted on the website. “If you keep pouring cold water over yourself while the temperature outside keeps falling, you’ll freeze to death,” he said. Inflation is no longer a major concern in China and tightening policies should be eased, Wang said. Banks’ loan quotas should be raised or eliminated and growth in M2 money supply should be expanded “as soon as possible” to at least 17 percent from an estimated 13 percent to 14 percent currently, he said. “A slump in growth can’t be avoided even if the government were to adjust its policies right now,” he said, forecasting a wave of closures among smaller enterprises that will peak at the beginning of next year. China has raised interest rates five times since mid October, boosted banks’ reserve requirements nine times to a record 21.5 percent for the largest lenders and limited credit to developers and home buyers to cool the surging property market. The central bank this month stepped up measures to squeeze liquidity from the banking system by expanding the base lenders use to calculate their required reserves to cover margin deposits. Momentum Weakening Inflation accelerated to a three-year high of 6.5 percent in July, a level economists estimate may be the peak for this cycle. Price gains likely slowed to 6.2 percent in August from a year earlier, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 26 analysts. “We’ve come to a point where growth momentum is weakening sharply because we’ve placed too much emphasis on fighting inflation,” Wang said. Expansion in the world’s second-largest economy will likely slow to 9.2 percent in the third quarter and to a range of 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent in the last three months of the year, Wang estimated. Growth cooled to 9.5 percent in the second quarter from 9.7 percent in the previous three months, according to statistics bureau data. --Victoria Ruan.

Nikolaou knows of what she speaks. Her family hails from a village overlooking Delphi, home of the Oracle and the secret formula for her ambrosia dessert: a 9 euro pistachio cream soup that demands a second portion. From Paris to Athens , Nikolaou says that even a perfectly grilled kefta meatball nowadays looks cheerless, as good an indicator as any on what happens next in Greece’s $473 billion sovereign debt drama, which has spilled over into a euro region crisis. Evi Evane for years has been a habitual eatery and talk shop for Greek diplomats in Paris and members of the city’s Greek community. She hears things. Desperate Generation “The mentality of the next generation of Greeks will not be good,” says Nikolaou, slicing up an inimitable baklava sweetened with cinnamon instead of honey. “What do they have to look forward to? Unemployment, closed businesses.

{"headline": "Zinc Output to Rise in Japan to Meet Post-Quake Demand Growth, Mitsui Says", "article": "Japan ’s zinc output will climb in 2012 as smelters run at full capacity to meet recovering demand from the auto and construction industries after the earthquake and tsunami, amid a forecast for a global deficit. The world’s third-biggest economy is expected to produce 590,000 metric tons of refined metal next year, 8.5 percent more than 2010, said Nobuyuki Nakamoto, general manager at Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co.’s zinc business. Demand may increase 5.5 percent to 540,000 tons in 2012, he said. A gain in global demand for the metal, used to galvanize steel, may help prices recover from a 14-month low on Sept. 26 and benefit producers such as Korea Zinc Co., Nyrstar (NYR) NV and Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) The metal has declined 20 percent this year. Demand will exceed supply by 106,000 tons in 2012 from a surplus of 178,000 tons in 2011, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. “Domestic consumption will rise next year for rebuilding and following a full recovery in car output,” Nakamoto said in an interview yesterday. In the three months to December, Japan’s automakers are expected to increase production to make up for losses in April to June following the disaster, he said. Production by steelmakers has recovered close to the level before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. pushed the world into recession, Nakamoto said, citing the company’s recent survey in the sector. Japan was Asia ’s third-biggest zinc consumer after China and South Korea in 2010, according to the International Lead & Zinc Study Group. Demand was 516,000 tons last year, 4 percent of the world’s 12.6 million tons. Supply Deficit The metal will average $2,310 a ton in 2011 and $2,425 in 2012, Michael Widmer , head of metals research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London , wrote in a report on Sept. 27. Widmer was the second-most accurate forecaster for the metal for the eight consecutive quarters ended March 31, according to Bloomberg data. Zinc for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange climbed 1.7 percent to $1,957 a ton at 4:50 p.m. Tokyo time. The market will see a deficit next year from a moderate surplus this year with solid demand from the construction sector, recent drops in refined production and declining unreported stockpiles in China, analysts at Macquarie, including Duncan Hobbs in London, wrote in a report on Sept. 26. Physical market prices signal steady metal premiums at high levels and falling treatment charges for concentrates, Macquarie said. The metal will stay within a range of $2,000 to $2,500 a ton over the next six to 12 months, the bank said. Japan Imports A recovery in output will reduce the country’s imports of refined metal next year to the lowest level since 2002, while helping boost exports, Nakamoto said. The auto sector in Japan accounts for 50 percent of demand, followed by construction with 30 percent and electronics with 20 percent, he said. The country’s imports are projected to drop to 25,000 tons in 2012 from an estimated 77,000 tons this year, the highest level since 2000, he said. The country may export 80,000 tons to 90,000 tons in 2012, compared with an estimated 83,000 tons in 2011, he said. “If current lower prices last longer, some high-cost producers will be forced to cut output or out of business,” Nakamoto said. Production costs of about 40 percent of the smelters in the world are estimated at $1,850 a ton, he said. Nakamoto projects zinc for immediate delivery may trade in a range between $1,600 and $2,600 a ton over the next 12 months with an average price between $2,200 and $2,300. Mitsui Mining’s zinc output may increase to 116,000 tons in the six months starting from Oct. 1, up 25 percent from April to September and up 11.5 percent from the same period a year earlier, he said. The company will release its six-month output plan in early October.

{"headline": "IRS Inspector General Warns of Alarming Rate of Identity Theft", "article": "Criminals are continuing to file falsified tax returns using other people’s identities to receive tax refunds, Russell George, the inspector general for the Internal Revenue Service , told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee. “Unscrupulous individuals are stealing identities at an alarming rate,” he said today in Washington. George cited IRS data showing that in 2011, the agency detected about 940,000 tax returns involving identity theft and stopped $6.5 billion in refunds from being issued. The total amount of identity theft is larger than that and unknown. There is a fundamental tension between the IRS’s goals of processing tax returns quickly and stopping fraud, said Nina Olson , the national taxpayer advocate. “There is no way around these tradeoffs,” said Olson, who runs an independent taxpayer service department within the IRS. Steven Miller , deputy commissioner of the IRS, told the House panel that the agency has made progress on identity theft. This year, he said, about 250,000 taxpayers who had identity theft cases from prior years received personal identification numbers that authenticate their identity to the IRS. “We are not done but we have made real progress in the area,” he said.

{"headline": "Sovcomflot Says Gazprom’s Shtokman Needs $4 Billion Fleet", "article": "The OAO Gazprom-led Shtokman project to produce liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from a Barents Sea field almost 600 kilometers (370 miles) from shore may require a $4 billion fleet to transport the fuel. The Shtokman project, which includes Total SA (FP) and Statoil ASA (STL) , may require 20 tankers, which in total will cost that sum, Evgeny Ambrosov, senior executive vice president of Sovcomflot told reporters today in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia. Gazprom, Russia’s largest gas producer, and its partners have delayed an investment decision on the Shtokman project to the end of this year as shale gas production in the U.S., the target market, damped demand for LNG. That pushed some cargoes to Europe , pushing down prices in a potential market. Russia’s largest shipper is seeking to open an Arctic sea lane to Asia for large-scale commercial use during a five-month navigable season. Sovcomflot has reduced the time to navigate the passage by one to 7.3 days in test runs this year, Ambrosov said. OAO Novatek, Russia ’s second-largest gas producer, has tested the route with cargoes of condensate before building a plant to produce LNG on Russia’s Yamal peninsula. State- controlled OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, and Glencore International Plc, the world’s largest commodities trader, have also shown interest in the route, Ambrosov said. Novatek’s Arctic Yamal LNG project, in which Total is a partner, may be the world’s most complex undertaking of its kind, Ambrosov said. Sovcomflot plans to triple volumes of oil products it ships to 150 million metric tons in 2014, Ambrosov said. The tanker market continues to be “very tough,” he said. The Russian government, which owns 100 percent of Sovcomflot, may sell shares next year.

{"headline": "Bovis Rises to Highest Since July 2007 on First-Half Profit", "article": "Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) rose to the highest in almost six years after the U.K. homebuilder said it had a “significant improvement” in first-half profit as sales volumes and prices beat the company’s expectations. Bovis was up 55 pence, or 7.1 percent, to 830 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the highest since July 2007. That brought this year’s gain to about 44 percent. “Trading in the first half of 2013 has been strong and the group has achieved a 40 percent increase in private reservations compared to the same period in 2012,”  Chief Executive Officer David Ritchie said in a statement today. The housing market has shown signs of a “strong” improvement, helped by the government’s Help to Buy loan program, Bovis said. In the six months ended June 30, Bovis completed 963 homes compared with 944 a year earlier, the Longfield, England-based company said. The average selling price of a Bovis home increased 15 percent to 188,500 pounds ($281,000), according to the statement. Prime Minister David Cameron is using homebuilding to help stimulate the economy, with the government in March announcing that it would offer an equity loan of as much as 20 percent of the value of a newly built home valued at 600,000 pounds or less. The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme also eased home lending as the government has tried to bolster housing by simplifying planning laws. The Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index has gained 37 percent this year, led by Persimmon Plc (PSN) with a 70 percent advance. Bovis, which will report half-year results on Aug. 19, has had the index’s fifth-best increase.

{"headline": "Weill’s Penthouse Bought for Russian Billionaire’s Daughter", "article": "A Manhattan penthouse owned by Sanford Weill, former chairman of Citigroup Inc. (C) , and listed for $88 million, is being purchased for the daughter of Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. A company associated with Ekaterina Rybolovleva signed a contract to purchase the 6,744-square-foot (627-square-meter), full-floor condominium at 15 Central Park West , Alan Basiev, a spokesman for Rybolovlev, said in an e-mail. Rybolovleva, who is studying at a U.S. university, plans to stay at the apartment when visiting New York, Basiev said. Her father, ranked number 93 on the Forbes list of the world’s billionaires with a net worth of $9.5 billion, is the former owner of fertilizer maker OAO Uralkali. The condominium was listed for sale by brokerage Brown Harris Stevens last month. Weill and his wife, Joan, paid $43.7 million for the property in 2007, according to city records. “Given that the sale was done so quietly and quickly, it probably sold at or near the listing price,” said Jonathan Miller , president of appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. The average sale takes about four months, he said. A sale anywhere close to $88 million would make it the most expensive residential transaction ever in Manhattan, according to Miller. The prior record was the $53 million sale of a townhouse to private-equity investor J. Christopher Flowers in 2006, Miller said. That property resold on Aug. 15 for $36.5 million, he said. Weak U.S. Dollar “Right now we’re seeing a whole slew of trophy-property sales,” Miller said. “This is in part due to the weak dollar, which is driving foreign investments.” Sales of Manhattan luxury apartments, defined as the top 10 percent of all condo and co-op transactions by price, jumped 17 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Miller Samuel and broker Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The four-bedroom Central Park West condo features a wraparound terrace, two wood-burning fireplaces and a library, according to a floor plan on Brown Harris’s website. Amy Gotzler, a spokeswoman at Brown Harris, declined to comment today. The agreement was reported yesterday by the New York Observer.

{"headline": "Russia Seeks ‘Foothold’ in Asian Wheat Market to Rival U.S.", "article": "Russia , set to be the third-largest wheat shipper, aims to secure a “foothold” among buyers in Asia, increasing competition for U.S. and Australian supplies. “One of the new and promising directions for Russian grain exports is the Asia-Pacific region,” Andrey Klepach, the deputy minister of economic development, said in a message to delegates at a conference in Singapore. The segment “is now rapidly evolving and Russia has all the chances to gain a foothold.” Futures dropped 20 percent in the past year as global crops and stockpiles headed for records and trade rose to the second- highest level in at least in five decades. The U.S., the biggest exporter, has already lost market share to Russia in North Africa and the Middle East and faces competition from record Australian shipments in Asia. More supply may curb food costs the United Nations says climbed the most in 11 months in January. Southeast Asian importers rely on supplies from Australia (US46EXAU) , the U.S., Canada and India , according to the Russian Grain Union. Import demand in the region, the third biggest after North Africa and the Middle East, climbed almost 40 percent to 15.85 million metric tons in the past four years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  Indonesia is the largest buyer. The U.S. is already selling less to North Africa and the Middle East because of Russia, the USDA says. Shipments to Egypt , the top buyer, slumped to 246,739 tons from June 1 to Feb. 9 compared with 2.44 million tons a year earlier when drought prompted Russia to ban exports, U.S. government data show. ‘Grain Corridor’ Exports from Russia (US46EXRU) will climb fivefold to a record 20.5 million tons this year, said the U.S. agency. Russia plans the “the creation of the Far East grain corridor” allowing exports to Southeast Asia, said Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik in a conference message. The Russian Grain Union, hosting the conference, is seeking to “attract interest to the agro-industrial sector of Siberia and Far East, modernization of storage, processing and transshipment infrastructure,” said Arkady Zlochevsky, group president. While shipments are limited by infrastructure, exports to Asia are expanding “very fast” and may total 1 million tons this year, said Zlochevsky. The country will probably maintain overall sales at 22 million tons in 2012-2013, he said. U.S. (US46EXUS) exports may contract 24 percent to 26.5 million tons this year, the most since the season ended 1986, USDA data show. Australian exports are poised to jump 20 percent to an all-time high, says the country’s government forecaster. Australia has a record harvest and will sell its grain into Asian markets “ahead of anywhere else,” said Alan Winney, chairman of Emerald Group Australia Pty, the nation’s fifth- largest grain handler, in an interview this week.

{"headline": "Atheist Dawkins Turns Hate Mail Into YouTube Comedy", "article": "The world’s foremost atheist devotes a lot of time and resources to believers. Teaching little kids they’re worthless sinners headed for hell is child abuse, said Richard Dawkins over lunch at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. The evolutionary biologist was here to talk about “An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist,” in which he describes growing up in Africa , his intellectual awakening at Oxford and the publication of “The Selfish Gene.” Lundborg: What are the best things you remember about growing up? Dawkins: Smells, sights, colors, nothing very coherent. It was just where my family lived. We had a very spoiled life, I suppose: It was like England in Edwardian times -- servants, meals cooked, beds made. I was sent away to boarding school at a very young age which is probably not ideal, but I think I had a good education. I didn’t come away with much of a naturalist view of Africa, though. I don’t think I ever saw an elephant or a giraffe or a lion. Lundborg: In your teens, you were a big Elvis fan -- he gave you religious inspiration? Child Abuse Dawkins: It came as a blinding Damascus experience when I saw this album by Elvis called, “I Believe.” I thought this was a call from God that I should devote my life to propagating not actually Christianity -- I’d seen through Christianity by then -- but some kind of deism. It was my moment of thinking there was some kind of creative force behind the universe. Lundborg: And then what happened? Dawkins: I saw the light -- the Darwinian light. Lundborg: You’ve since decided to combat religion -- how is it child abuse? Dawkins: For one, telling children they’re going to hell, which is, of course, totally harmless if they don’t believe it. There’s a kind of law of inverse horribleness that the more implausible a threat is, the more horrible it has to be. The threat that you’re going to roast forever in hell is so implausible it has to be made really horrible. That’s abuse because you are threatening a child with unspeakable horrors that never end. Lundborg: You have two foundations , one in England and one in the U.S. Dawkins: More than 40 percent of the American people according to Gallup polls believe the world is less than 10,000 years old. That’s a very serious figure. It’s like believing North America is less than 10 yards wide. We do mostly education, producing DVDs, YouTube films, sponsoring lectures and things like the Clergy Project. Atheist Clergy Lundborg: Yes, for ministers who have lost their faith. Dawkins: They’ve become atheist, but have kept quiet about it because they can’t bear the thought of losing their jobs and their families in some cases, their social networks, their social respect. So, we set up a website with a high degree of confidentiality for these clergymen and clergywomen to meet each other online to discuss their common problems, cry on each other’s shoulders and eventually encourage each other to come out, which they’ve now started doing. Lundborg: You travel around saying a lot of inflammatory things about God. What’s the reception like? Dawkins: I go out of my way to visit the Bible belt. Everywhere you go in the Bible belt, they claim to be the buckle. My experience is you get a warmer reception there than you do somewhere like New York or San Francisco. The people who come are beleaguered and threatened and then they see that there are a couple of thousand others there and they get encouragement from that. I serve the purpose of bringing them together. Hate Mail Lundborg: You must get a lot of hate mail? Dawkins: Yes. My policy is to turn it into comedy and post it on YouTube. We had a log fire and I was in a dressing gown and slippers. I read out this appalling noxious hate mail to the accompaniment of laughter from the film crew. There were things like: “I hope you get a painful cancer,” and “I hope you get run over by a church van.” Lundborg: Is it always anonymous? Dawkins: There was one from Ann Coulter, who said it was impossible to imagine not laughing at the thought of Dawkins roasting in hell. Lundborg: I expect there’s no point in trying reason with faith or with sentiment like that? Dawkins: Reason may not always be the thing -- but in this case ridicule works.

{"headline": "GSW Reports Profit on Higher Rental Income, Property Sales", "article": "GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , Germany ’s third- largest residential landlord by market value, reported a second- quarter profit after rental income increased and it sold properties. Net income was 16.3 million euros ($20 million), or 34 cents a share, compared with a restated loss of 4.4 million euros, or 11 cents, a year earlier, the company said in a statement today. GSW, based in Berlin, said it will post 2012 funds from operations excluding divestments of 61 million euros to 64 million euros, compared with an earlier forecast of 59 million euros to 63 million euros. The company only operates in Berlin and is benefiting from rising demand for homes in Germany’s capital. Apartment rents have gained about 8 percent in the past year and 26 percent in five years, according to Berlin-based online broker ImmobilienScout24. Net rental income rose to 39.2 million euros in the second quarter from 34.8 million euros a year earlier. Income from property sales increased to 2.7 million euros from 1.3 million euros a year earlier. Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a company’s ability to generate cash, climbed 12 percent to 32.6 million euros in the first half. Cerberus Capital GSW, which has 53,000 apartments valued at about 2.9 billion euros, was owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until an initial public offering in April 2011. The company said in May it plans to increase the number of homes it owns by as many as 7,000, or 13 percent. Joerg Schwagenscheidt, GSW’s chief operating officer, said on a conference call today that he’s “optimistic” talks will lead to an acquisition. GSW fell 1.1 percent to 30.39 euros at 2:18 p.m. in Frankfurt trading. The shares have gained about 39 percent this year, while the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT’s index of German real estate companies has advanced 27 percent.

{"headline": "India Inflation Quickens, Curbing Room for Cutting Rates", "article": "Indian inflation unexpectedly accelerated in April, crimping the central bank’s scope to bolster economic growth by extending interest-rate cuts. Stocks fell, reversing earlier gains. The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 7.23 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 6.89 percent in March, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement in New Delhi today. The median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.67 percent gain. Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao signaled last month that inflation might limit the room for further cuts after he slashed the benchmark rate by half a percentage point, flagging price risks from the fiscal deficit, energy costs and a weaker rupee. Greece ’s political turmoil and a deepening debt crisis in Europe are increasing pressure on Asian nations to support growth as exports falter from Taiwan to Malaysia. China cut banks’ reserve requirements on May 12 to revive demand. “The Reserve Bank of India faces somewhat of a dilemma,” Robert Prior-Wandesforde , Singapore-based director of Asian economics at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note after the report. “Our guess is that the chance of a June rate move has diminished.” Sensex Falls The BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) fell 0.5 percent in Mumbai, after rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier in the day. The five-day decline is the longest losing streak this year. The yield on the 8.79 percent note due November 2021 rose two basis points immediately after the inflation data, It ended five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, lower at 8.52 percent on speculation the central bank will step up debt purchases through open-market operations and add cash to the banking system. The Reserve Bank lowered the repurchase rate on April 17 for the first time since 2009, by 50 basis points to 8 percent. A report last week showed Indian industrial production unexpectedly contracted in March as weaker domestic demand and tumbling exports hurt the economy. “The inflation numbers are a very uncomfortable statistic,” Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said in New Delhi today. “Many people have been calling for an easing in monetary policy but it makes it difficult for RBI to moderate policy. It is not a good sign.” Worst Performer Concern India’s outlook has worsened because of trade and fiscal deficits, political gridlock, elevated inflation and faltering global growth has pushed the nation’s currency toward a record low. That prompted the central bank to say last week exporters must convert half their foreign-currency earnings into rupees as it stepped up efforts to check the decline. The currency weakened 0.6 percent to 53.9575 per dollar in Mumbai. It is down about 17 percent in the past year, the worst performer in a basket of 11 most-traded Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Governor Subbarao’s 13 interest-rate increases in the last two years helped tame price pressures in a nation where 75 percent of the people live on less than $2 a day. The wholesale- price inflation gauge has fallen below 9 percent in 2012, after breaching that level most of last year. Aside from cutting the benchmark rate, the central bank has also reduced the amount of deposits lenders must set aside as reserves twice this year by a combined 125 basis points, to 4.75 percent, to ease cash shortages in the banking system. Fastest Inflation Credit Suisse predicts India will cut its repurchase rate by another 125 basis points by March 2013, Prior-Wandesforde said today. Still, the central bank’s scope to cut interest rates further to boost growth is constrained by the threat of price increases, Ashima Goyal, a member of the bank’s technical advisory committee, said in an interview in Mumbai last week. While the wholesale price gauge has cooled after the Reserve Bank raised rates by a record 3.75 percentage points from mid-March 2010 to October last year, India still has the highest inflation in the so-called BRIC group of biggest emerging markets that also includes Brazil, Russia and China. “The inflation number underscores that the room to ease monetary policy is quite limited because there are still upside risks to inflation,” said Leif Eskesen, Singapore-based chief economist for India and Southeast Asia at HSBC Holdings Plc. “There isn’t a lot of spare capacity in the economy because growth has slowed on the back of policy paralysis, lack of structural reforms and therefore it makes inflation a structural problem rather than a cyclical one.” Maruti Profits Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the nation’s biggest carmaker, posted a 3 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit because of high raw material costs and discounts on some models. The country imports 80 percent of its annual crude requirements and the government compensates state oil firms for selling products below market prices. Asia’s third-largest economy probably expanded 6.9 percent in the 12 months through March 2012, the least in three years, government estimates show. Standard & Poor’s cut India’s credit outlook to negative from stable last month, putting at risk its investment grade status.

{"headline": "Snowstorm Moving in From Plains Threatens Northeast", "article": "A weather system that may drop more than a foot of snow in parts of the U.S. Great Plains is expected to move into New England tomorrow, the region’s third winter storm in as many weeks. Kansas City International Airport was scheduled to remain closed until at least 10 a.m. local time as the system moved toward the Northeast. Winter storm warnings and advisories stretched from South Dakota to New Jersey, including Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, the National Weather Service said. A winter storm watch, meaning snow and sleet may affect travel, has been posted for central Massachusetts to Maine starting tomorrow. The watch may be extended to include Boston later today, according to the weather service. “This will be the third significant snow storm for many locations,” said Charlie Foley , a weather service meteorologist in Taunton, Massachusetts. “It will be a heavy wet snow. There may be winds of 40 to 50 miles per hour, and that increases the risk of power outages.” Hannibal, Missouri , received 13.5 inches (34 centimeters) of snow yesterday and St. Louis got 5.7, the weather service said. Parts of Kansas reported snow falling at rates of 4 inches per hour to a depth of 14 inches, accompanied by thunderstorms. Chicago Snow Chicago may receive as much as 5 inches today, according to the agency. As of 9 a.m. East Coast time, 425 flights had been canceled, 237 of them passing through Chicago ’s O’Hare airport, according to FlightAware , a Houston-based airline tracking company. Ninety-minute delays are being reported at O’Hare, according to the Federal Aviation Administration Yesterday, 831 flights in the U.S. were scrubbed, with 256 of them arriving at or departing from Kansas City International in Missouri, FlightAware’s website showed. New York City will get mainly rain starting tonight into the next morning, said Dan Hoffman, a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York. There may be periods when snow falls during the night, he said. “You could see some flakes at the beginning and at the end, but nothing is going to stick,” Hoffman said. “It’s not a major storm; it is an inconvenience for the weekend.” Foley said the storm’s track will determine how much snow an area gets because forecasters expect mostly rain on the eastern side. That’s made it difficult to predict how much snow will fall in Boston. Yesterday, the weather service released a forecast calling for only an inch of snow in Boston and its southern suburbs. That was revised overnight to 2 to 4 inches.. Foley said the storm won’t have the power of the blizzard that struck New England starting Feb. 8, killing at least seven people and dropping 24.9 inches of snow on Boston.

{"headline": "Oven on Boeing 787 Overheats During Air India Flight", "article": "Air India Ltd., the nation’s only operator of Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787, said an oven for warming food on a Dreamliner overheated during a domestic flight, prompting the crew to take measures to contain smoke. The oven’s overheating on the flight from New Delhi to the eastern city of Kolkata on July 24 didn’t cause a fire, Air India spokesman G. Prasada Rao said by telephone today. The flight was not diverted because of the incident and the aircraft continues to be in service, he said. The latest incident involving a 787 comes amid U.S. aviation regulators ordering inspections of emergency beacons that were linked to a July 12 fire on a Dreamliner parked at London ’s Heathrow Airport. Air India, which has taken delivery of seven of the jets, has begun removing the emergency locator transmitters as a precautionary measure, according to an India civil aviation ministry official. India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation is looking into what may have caused the oven’s overheating, Arun Mishra, who heads the regulator, said in a mobile phone text message. He didn’t elaborate. The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday issued an order that United Continental Holdings Inc., the only U.S. airline flying the Dreamliner, must complete the inspections of emergency locator transmitters by Aug. 5. The blaze that broke out on an Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise 787 parked at Heathrow was traced to a Honeywell International Inc. (HON) transmitter powered by a lithium battery. More Protection Bhawna Singh, Boeing’s external spokeswoman in India, didn’t immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comments on the Air India incident. The Mumbai-based carrier, which has 20 more 787s on order, is adding new destinations including Sydney and Melbourne using the Dreamliners. In January, the global fleet of 787s was grounded because of overheating of lithium-ion batteries on two of the aircraft. The FAA cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing redesigned the battery to include more protection around individual cells to contain any overheating, a steel case to prevent fire and a tube to vent any vapors outside the fuselage. The incident on the Air India Dreamliner was earlier reported by Mint newspaper.

Euro-area countries may have to double their bailout fund to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) to cover a crisis in Italy , the European Central Bank said, according to German newspaper Die Welt, citing unidentified “high-ranking” people at central banks. ‘No Discussion’ German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said “there’s no discussion whatsoever” of doubling the European Union’s rescue facility after the Die Welt report. The Financial Times cited unidentified senior officials as saying European leaders are prepared to accept that Greece should default on some of its bonds. Ten-year Italian yields soared to the highest level in 10 years. The spreads investors demand to hold Italian, Portuguese and Spanish debt over German bunds widened to euro-era records.

{"headline": "Seven-Time NBA All-Star Grant Hill Retires After 19 Seasons", "article": "Seven-time All-Star Grant Hill, at age 40 the oldest active player in the National Basketball Association in 2012-2013, has retired after 19 seasons. Hill, who played his final season with the Los Angeles Clippers , ends his career after playing 1,026 regular-season games averaging 16.7 points, 4.1 assists and 6.0 rebounds per game. He also earned an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 1996 U.S. team in Atlanta. “I’m completely at peace with my decision to retire, but it was not arrived at lightly,” Hill said in a statement. “On one hand, I’m 40 years old and still in great physical condition. My body tells me that I can continue playing. On the other hand, I’m 40 years old and still in great physical condition - a rare parting gift in this sport.” Hill played his rookie season in 1994 as a member of the Detroit Pistons after being selected as the team’s third overall pick. He made NBA history as the first rookie to top the league in fan voting for the All-Star game and was co-Rookie of the Year. He played six years for the Pistons, another six for the Orlando Magic and five for the Phoenix Suns before joining the Clippers, who lost to the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the NBA playoffs. “For 19 years, Grant has always been the embodiment of class, a true professional and not only one of the best players - but one of the finest individuals I have been around,” said Clippers Vice President of Basketball Operations Gary Sacks on the team’s website. “We were fortunate to have Grant with us last season, and we wish him all the best in his next endeavor.” Hill was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Board of Governors in 2011, the first and only active NBA player to hold the position. He won’t be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame until 2018. As a member of Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski ’s Blue Devils, Hill played in three Final Fours, winning back-to-back National Collegiate Athletic Association national championships in 1991 and 1992.

{"headline": "Treasuries Fall on Speculation Price Data to Show Inflation Above Average", "article": "Treasuries fell, snapping yesterday’s biggest rally in two weeks, before government reports today and tomorrow that economists said will show inflation is running faster than average. Ten-year notes yield negative 1.63 percentage points after accounting for consumer prices. The figure was negative 2.05 percentage points on Sept. 22, the least since 1980. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said the Fed risks stoking costs in the economy by trying to boost growth. “Inflation remains elevated,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. BNP’s U.S. unit is one of the 22 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “Growth should pick up next year, and yields will go up.” Benchmark 10-year rates advanced one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.17 percent as of 6:41 a.m. in London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent security due in August 2021 declined 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 19/32. The yield slid nine basis points yesterday, the most since Oct. 3, as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis spurred demand for the relative safety of U.S. debt. Rates will rise to 3 percent by the end of 2012, BNP said in an Oct. 13 report. Japan’s 10-year yield increased half a basis point to 1.025 percent, matching yesterday’s high, the most in two weeks. Inflation Data Producer prices probably increased 6.4 percent in September from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the Labor Department reports the figure today. The 10-year average is 2.9 percent. Consumer prices rose 3.9 percent, versus the average of 2.4 percent, based on a separate Bloomberg survey before the department issues the figure tomorrow. Lacker said the central bank may increase costs in the economy by trying to boost growth because the recovery is hampered by conditions that are unaffected by monetary policy. “History has repeatedly demonstrated that if a central bank attempts to add monetary stimulus to offset nonmonetary disturbances to growth, the result is higher inflation,” he said yesterday in the text of a speech in Salisbury, Maryland. The Fed is scheduled to buy $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to August 2041 today, according to the central bank website, as part of its plan to keep borrowing costs down. Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the U.S. faces “massive shortfalls in output and employment” and called for new policy steps to ensure the central bank meets its congressional mandate, speaking yesterday in a speech in Detroit. Safety Demand Europe’s debt crisis may sustain demand for the relative safety of American securities, said Michael Turner , a fixed- income and currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “There’s a fair bit of caution out there among investors,” he said. “In that environment, Treasuries should remain reasonably well-supported.” The company’s U.S. branch is another primary dealer. German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s office damped expectations for what it called “dreams” that an Oct. 23 summit will tame the European crisis. Efforts to bolster Europe ’s bailout fund by offering to guarantee portions of the debt owed by the region’s weaker governments are threatening France ’s top credit ranking. The rating is under pressure, Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday, with investors demanding almost 1 percentage point more to hold French bonds instead of German notes. “The negative risk sentiment tied to Europe is dominating everything,” said Adrian Miller , fixed-income strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York. “Expectations of a resolution have been far overblown.” Inflation Protection Investors should favor short-term Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, said Michael Pond, a bond strategist for Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, another primary dealer. “Inflation is coming in well above what the market’s priced for,” Pond said yesterday on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with Tom Keene. The difference between yields on two-year notes and TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, has fallen to 1.27 percentage points from this year’s high of 2.70 percentage points in April.

{"headline": "NWR in Talks With Potential Partners for Debiensko Coal Mine", "article": "New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the largest Czech producer of coal for steelmakers, said it’s seeking a partner to help develop the Debiensko mine in Poland. “This is Europe’s largest deposit of hard quality coking coal,” Chairman Gareth Penny said in an interview in Prague. “We are looking at potential partners.” Developing Debiensko is part of a plan for NWR to become Europe’s leading coking coal supplier in the next decade, said Penny, the former chief executive officer of De Beers, the biggest diamond producer. The company is cutting output of thermal coal to focus on more profitable coking coal that’s supplied to steel producers such as ArcelorMittal (MT) and carmakers including Volkswagen AG. (VOW)  Debiensko is a “really important part of NWR’s long-term future,” Penny said in yesterday’s interview. He dismissed reports that the company may try to sell the mine because of technical difficulties with underground water. NWR has held “very early-stage” talks with some Polish coal companies as well as financial investors and even customers to cooperate on the project, according to Penny. The company, which is listed in London, Prague and Warsaw, is in the process of buying up the land around the mine, a process that should be finished in April, Penny said. NWR was little changed at 79.5 koruna in Prague today. The stock has lost 19 percent so far this year, adding to a 28 percent retreat in 2012. Safety Review Last year the miner cut planned spending at Debiensko to 5 million euros ($6.6 million) from 50 million euros following the discovery of large quantities of underground water. A technical and safety review proved the project is “viable” and the company doubled capital spending for the mine, which contains an estimated 190 million metric tons of coking coal, to 10 million euros this year, Penny said. NWR plans to boost imports of coking coal into Europe from the U.S. and is considering buying mines in North America. It had 267 million euros in cash at the end of last year. “Valuations in coal right now are very attractive,” Chief Financial Officer Marek Jelinek said in an interview. “We have a lot of cash on our balance sheet which in the current business environment isn’t earning us anything, so the most accretive way to finance an acquisition today would be to use that cash.” To contact the reporter on this story: Ladka Bauerova in Prague at  lbauerova@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at  wkennedy3@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "New World Resources Plc(NWR)는 어떤 석탄 생산에 집중하고 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "NWR이 Debiensko 광산 개발을 위해 파트너를 찾는 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "NWR이 Debiensko 광산 개발을 통해 유럽의 주요 코킹 석탄 공급자가 되려는 전략은 어떤 리스크와 리턴을 가지고 있나요?"}]}
{"headline": "Canada Fourth Quarter National Balance Sheet Account (Text)", "article": "The following is the text of Canada ’s national balance sheet account report for the fourth quarter released by Statistics Canada. National net worth increased 0.8% to $6.6 trillion in the fourth quarter, as a result of higher values of non-financial assets. National wealth was $6.8 trillion while non-resident claims were $0.2 trillion. National net worth National net worth on a per capita basis increased to $190,900 in the fourth quarter from $189,700 in the third quarter. Non-financial assets were up $60 billion to $6.8 trillion in the fourth quarter, which accounted for the change in national net worth. This increase was moderated by the increase in Canada’s net foreign debt, as growth in international liabilities outpaced that of international assets. Rise in share values increases household net worth Household net worth was up nearly 1% in the fourth quarter, led by gains in the values of household holdings of equities (including mutual funds) and pension assets. The increase in equities reflected a 2.9% rise in the Standard and Poor’s / Toronto Stock Exchange composite index, following a 12% decrease in the third quarter. Per capita household net worth rose to $182,100 in the fourth quarter from $180,600 in the third quarter. Household sector assets Household credit market debt increased in the fourth quarter despite a slower rate of borrowing in consumer credit and mortgages. This led to an increase in the ratio of credit market debt to net worth to 25.3% from 25.2% in the third quarter. The debt service ratio was unchanged in the fourth quarter. The ratio of credit market debt to personal disposable income declined to 150.6% in the fourth quarter from 151.9% in the third quarter as personal disposable income increased at a faster rate than credit market debt. Government net debt up Total government net debt (expressed at book value) increased to $812 billion in the fourth quarter from $794 billion in the third quarter. The ratio of total government net debt to gross domestic product rose to 47.3% from 46.8%. In the third quarter of 2008, this ratio was 35.7%, and has increased for 13 consecutive quarters. The increase in government debt largely reflected an increase in federal bond issues, which outpaced redemptions of short-term paper. Private non-financial corporate debt to equity down The ratio of total private non-financial corporation credit market debt to equity (expressed at book value) eased to 54.2% in the fourth quarter, continuing a downward trend from 2008. The decline during the fourth quarter was largely caused by strong growth in corporate undistributed earnings, as the rate of share issuances and borrowing were lower in the quarter. Corporate debt-to-equity Value of assets held by financial institutions increases Note to readers Canadian publicly traded companies have begun their transition to International Financial Reporting Standards in the first quarter of 2011. As all companies adopt the new reporting standards over the next quarters, this will have an affect on the National Balance Sheet Accounts (NBSA). For more information on some of these impacts, consult the following article: “Impact of new accounting standards on the Financial and Wealth Accounts.” The NBSA comprise the balance sheets of all sectors of the economy: the persons and unincorporated business (households), corporate, government, and non-resident sectors. They cover all national non-financial assets and financial claims and their associated liabilities outstanding in all sectors. National net worth is national wealth less net foreign liabilities (that is, what is owed to non-residents less what non-residents owe to Canadians). Alternatively, it is the sum of the net worth of the persons and unincorporated business, corporate, and government sectors. Household credit market debt comprises consumer credit, mortgage, and loan debt of households, non-profit institutions serving households, and unincorporated businesses. Corporate equity is treated as a liability on the balance sheet of the corporate sector since it represents a claim by shareholders on the corporate sector. As a result, as equity prices increase, corporate net worth will tend to decline, reflecting the increase in the corporate sector’s equity liabilities. The historical revision to the Canadian National Accounts is scheduled for release beginning in October 2012. A schedule of releases has been posted on the National economic accounts website. Additional information will be posted as it becomes available. For more information, contact the information officer (csna- info-scnc@statcan.gc.ca ).

{"headline": "Energy, Housing and Trade Shield U.S. From Euro Crisis", "article": "Investors have been captivated by the European debt crisis. Just as in 2011, first-quarter gains in stock prices have given way to losses fueled by Europe’s springtime uprisings and political acrimony. In the 1990s, faced with the prospect of economic decline, European leaders were able to prolong their untenable government largesse by linking arms and unifying around a common currency. The euro enabled Germany to price its goods and services by some estimates 30 percent below what they would have been had the deutschmark continued to exist. Meanwhile, southern European customers, suddenly holding a respected currency, found themselves with purchasing power. This economic symbiosis enabled the region to neglect economic reality. Now that the countries’ capacity to take on debt has reached its upper limit, Europe is weighed down by the reversal and by a rapidly aging population. Based on market activity, investors mistakenly think that Europe’s malaise will be contagious. Although there is an eerie parallel between debt burdens, the U.S. is somewhat insulated from Europe’s predicament. In many respects Europe’s loss is America’s gain. Manufacturing Surge Take manufacturing, for example. The recent surge in U.S. activity is the direct result of several trading advantages. After almost a decade of stagnant blue-collar wages, U.S. unit labor costs have become substantially cheaper than those in other developed markets, thanks in large part to gains in productivity and years of decline in the dollar. The cost of hiring an American manufacturing worker is 5 percent cheaper today than it was in 2000. Average European manufacturing wages rose 13 percent in dollar terms. In Spain and Italy they rose 27 percent and 33 percent, respectively. Now the table is tilted toward the U.S. Recent news that General Electric Co., the Boeing Co. and Ford Motor Co. will shift manufacturing capacity to the U.S. should come as no surprise. If GE has determined that making appliances is more cost competitive in Kentucky than in China or Mexico, what does that say about the edge the U.S. has over European countries? Consider, next, the natural gas revolution. In just a few years, the entire energy price structure in the U.S. has been turned on its head. Thanks to hydraulic fracturing technology, North America suddenly has abundant natural gas selling for about $2 per million BTU, while Europe is forced to pay $9. (In Asia , the price is $18 per million BTU.) The U.S. appears to be turning the corner on housing as well. Confidence among homebuilders spurted more than expected in May, reaching a five-year high. My team at Harris Private Bank estimates that national home prices , gauged against the broad economy, are slightly below fair value. This calculation is based on the observation that, for more than a year, new home construction has been trailing labor force gains , which is a crucial indicator of household formations. By the same measure, U.S. housing was 22 percent overvalued in the third quarter of 2006. In certain European markets, home prices have similarly adjusted; Ireland’s have been cut in half, and collapses in Spain and the U.K. are well known. Yet several countries haven’t seen a slump. In France , notably, home prices have just kept marching upward as if the global recession never happened. The typical French home is, amazingly, 10 percent more expensive now than six years ago. At the margin, international cities like Miami should benefit from a surge of foreign real estate buyers using cheap dollars to buy discounted homes. French Bubbles France appears to have bubbly prices for most things. A few weeks back, my colleagues and I conducted an unscientific study of worldwide elite hotel rates by logging onto the Four Seasons ’ web site for quotes on a four-night stay this coming New Year’s Eve. Not surprisingly, the cheapest rooms were in Bangkok and Shanghai , where thanks to relatively undervalued currencies the nightly rate was $285. In Las Vegas it was $374, in Beverly Hills $425 and in New York $855 (that price is tied to Times Square’s special status on the big night). What really jumped out was that the room in Paris, despite all of Europe’s economic woes, came to a whopping $1,210, hinting at excesses in Parisian real estate prices and in the euro. The European experience looks a lot like what happened in Japan , as the world’s manufacturing powerhouse and second- largest economy became the aged third-largest economy. The difference in Japan is its enormous debt load has been able to grow because most of it was self-funded. Despite its two-decade bear market , the Nikkei 225 index of Japanese stocks has exerted little gravitational pull on other bourses. From the Nikkei’s top in 1989, the index has generated a devastating minus-76 percent total return. Meanwhile, investors in the S&P 500 have multiplied their money fivefold. The dirty little secret was that Japan never took money-printing to the same level as Western central banks have today. A generational deflationary funk is thus much less probable in the U.S. of 2012 than in Japan of 1990. Europe and the U.S. have decoupled on several important fronts. Trade will certainly be a drag, but U.S. exports to the region represent only about 2 percent of gross domestic product", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "유럽의 경제 침체가 미국에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미국의 제조업이 다른 선진국보다 경쟁력이 있는 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "유럽의 경제 위기가 일본의 장기 침체와 비교할 때 어떤 차이점이 있는가?"}]}

{"headline": "K+S Seeks Potash Expansion, Tie-Ups as Plants Run at Full Steam", "article": "K+S AG , Europe’s largest potash producer, is considering takeovers to access more deposits as production at existing sites approaches full capacity, said Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner. Developing new reserves with partners is another option, according to Steiner, who spoke to journalists during a Nov. 19 visit to K+S’s salt facility in Bernburg, Germany. He declined to name potential partners or say how much the Kassel-based company would be willing to spend. “We are looking at possible new mines, including acquisitions” Steiner said. “We’d also consider a project with a local partner.” Failure to access new deposits means K+S risks having growth constrained, as demand for the crop nutrient recovers from a slump. The company’s initial plans to ally with EuroChem Mineral & Chemical Co. to develop a site in Russia fizzled out and a tender to reopen a state-owned potash mine in the east German town of Rossleben has been postponed. Global demand for potash is set to rise by 3 percent to 5 percent annually, the company forecasts. Growth is coinciding with a reduction in capacity and a shortage of skilled workers, as K+S’s existing mines suffer declines in grades and the closing of a site in France. Capacity for potash and magnesium is set to fall to about 7.5 million tons per year from 7.8 million tons. Even the lower level requires hiring miners and completing environmental projects to reduce wastewater emissions, measures that will require at least two years, Steiner said on Nov. 11. Full Speed K+S potash production will just exceed 7 million tons next year, implying a factory run rate approaching 100 percent, compared with an industry average of 85 percent, analysts said. “K+S currently has no chance of increasing potash capacity,” Andreas Heine , an equity analyst at UniCredit in Munich, wrote in a Nov. 18 report. Faced with production constraints, he reduced his share-price target to 52 euros from 54 euros, while recommending clients “hold” K+S stock. Analysts from Nomura, NordLB and Bankhaus Metzler have also reduced their targets since the company flagged lower capacity. “The declining production will be an ongoing topic” and the company faces losing market share, Heine said. “This highlights the importance of new mining projects.” K+S capacity struggles come against a backdrop of increasing production by global metal mining companies that have been attracted to the nutrient and have the funds to exploit acquired reserves. Vale SA, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, is pumping $4.5 billion into its Rio Colorado project in Argentina, and it will be supplying the market with 11 million tons by 2017. BHP Billiton Ltd. this month abandoned a $40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. EuroChem Struggles By contrast, K+S struggled to make a partnership work with Russia’s EuroChem, owned by Andrei Melnichenko , who is also the German company’s biggest shareholder. “EuroChem said they want to lose no more time on their project, while we would have liked to analyze the deposit more thoroughly before getting started,” Steiner said as explanation why a venture with the Russian fertilizer maker did not materialize. He said there are no talks about other projects with EuroChem. With no scope for raising volumes, the potash price is the only driver for the shares, said analyst Heine. After pushing through three price increases to European customers this year, the next raise may come as early as January. The average selling price for potash at K+S was 265.80 euros per metric ton in the quarter ended Sept. 30, 1 percent lower than in the second quarter. Until the first quarter, K+S had suffered declining prices for six consecutive quarters. “We are thinking about what prices we’ll call from the beginning of January,” Steiner said, adding that recent price increases of agricultural goods were supporting potash prices.

{"headline": "Asia Hedge Fund Startups Fall 38% as Big Funds Favored", "article": "The number Asian hedge fund startups fell 45 percent in the first half of the year as investors preferred larger funds amid volatile markets, according to Eurekahedge Pte. There were 60 new Asian hedge funds set up in the first six months of 2011, of which 14 were based in Singapore and 11 in Hong Kong , Eurekahedge said in an e-mailed reply to queries from Bloomberg News. There were 109 Asian hedge funds which started in the first half of last year and 169 in all of 2010, the Singapore-based industry data provider said. Hedge funds found it tough to raise capital as investors shifted to experienced managers or established firms with steady returns and staff dedicated to risk assessment after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 saw many funds freeze assets. Firms managing more than $500 million received almost 62 percent of the capital invested in Asia-focused hedge funds in the second quarter, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  “In this volatile environment, some asset allocators believe they will be safer in large funds with a high pedigree, which makes it difficult for startups with more talented but less known managers to raise capital,” said Frank Brochin, managing director at New York-based StoneWater Capital LLC, which invests in Asian hedge funds. Sze, Fuchs Azentus Capital Management Ltd., a Hong Kong-based hedge fund set up by Morgan Sze, global head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s principal strategies business, increased assets to more than $1.9 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said in July. Benjamin Fuchs, who leads the Global Opportunities Group proprietary trading desk at Nomura Holdings Inc., aims to start his own Hong Kong-based hedge fund with at least $400 million, two people with knowledge of the plan said. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2 percent in the first six months, after a 14 percent rally last year, as investors became concerned that an earthquake in Japan in March would stall the nation’s emergence from deflation, U.S.’s sovereign-debt would be downgraded and Chinese growth would slow as inflation accelerated. Standard & Poor’s downgraded U.S.’s debt rating on Aug. 5. The formation of a strong management team is the “main difficulty” of starting a hedge fund, said Roland Thng, a managing partner of Singapore-based Dektos Investment Corp., which aims to start a macro hedge fund by the first quarter of next year. Business Sustainability Thng, previously a currency trader at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., teamed up with Mario Manca, a former private banker at Barclays Wealth Management who has experience in risk management and business development, to set up the fund. Thng had attempted to start Dektos as a “one-man shop” a year and a half ago, he said. “I soon realized that this model doesn’t work,” Thng said. “Having a strong management team will allow regulatory agencies and investors to have strong confidence in the sustainability of the business.” Asian hedge funds may attract less money in coming weeks from U.S. institutional investors as they wait for a clearer reading of the global economic outlook, according to Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co., which invests in hedge funds. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 14.5 percent yesterday from this year’s high on May 2 on concern Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA could worsen an economic slowdown, the European sovereign debt crisis will spread and China ’s steps to stem inflation will slow growth. Investors poured $600 million into Asian hedge funds in June, even as managers lost about 1 percent that month, according to Eurekahedge. The region’s strategies lost 0.3 percent in the first half, while U.S. funds gained 2.2 percent, according to the data provider. Asia-focused hedge funds managed $89.5 billion in the second quarter, compared with a peak of $111.4 billion in 2007, according to Hedge Fund Research.

{"headline": "Duke Settles Probe, Principal Eyes Exits, RBS: Compliance", "article": "(Corrects to remove reference to bank exit from headline in Principal item and first paragraph of story published Nov. 30 and included in this column in the Compliance Action section.) Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers must step down by the end of next year as part of a settlement with North Carolina regulators stunned by a July boardroom coup. The settlement, which lays out a series of executive changes and employment and financial concessions, represents a rebuke to the largest U.S. utility owner by market value. Approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission would end its investigation into the ouster of former Progress Energy CEO Bill Johnson and reinstatement of Rogers hours after the company closed its $17.8 billion takeover of Progress. Commissioners had just approved the merger and accused Duke of misleading them with the CEO switch. “This settlement agreement is an important step forward for the company because it resolves one of our key near-term priorities: bringing closure to the NCUC merger review process,” Rogers said in a statement released after the close of trading in New York Nov. 29. Duke will create a special committee of the board comprised equally of pre-merger Duke and Progress directors to choose a successor for Rogers, according to a filing Nov. 29 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The committee “will make its best effort” to have a new chairman, president and CEO of Duke in place by July 1, and no later than Dec. 31, 2013, according to the settlement. The agreement doesn’t affect a separate investigation by North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper into whether Duke’s actions violated state law,” Sam Watson, general counsel for the commission, said in a telephone interview. Johnson was named Nov. 5 to become CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal power agency. For more, click here. Compliance Policy O’Malia Says CFTC to Vote on Swap Execution Facilities Dec. 12 Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Scott D. O’Malia said a vote on swap execution facilities is expected at a rule- making open meeting planned for Dec. 12. O’Malia made the comment in remarks prepared for a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association conference in New York. Commissioner O’Malia, a Republican, also foresees action on the cross-border impact of Dodd-Frank Act derivatives rules that will focus on delayed compliance, according to his remarks at the Sifma conference. Fed, Treasury Seeking Comments on Bank Fund Transfer Definitions The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve said Nov. 29 they are requesting comments on proposed changes to the definitions of “funds transfer” and “transmittal of funds” under the Bank Secrecy Act. The changes are needed to update the definitions of transfers and transmittals to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed and Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in a joint statement. Comments are due Jan. 25. Bank Regulations Harming Credit Flow to Business, A&O Says Tighter financial regulation around the world is constraining bank lending to businesses, according to research published today by Allen & Overy LLP, which polled its regulatory and finance lawyers. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s incoming rules and U.K. recommendations from the Independent Commission on Banking may “have much wider economic impacts” than the changes intend, including stifling credit, A&O said. The law firm asked its employees whether new regulations were having a positive, neutral or negative impact on the availability of credit across 11 separate areas of finance, including corporate lending, bonds and trade finance, in 13 countries. The so-called Basel III rules would more than triple the core capital that banks must hold as a buffer against insolvency, while the U.K. recommendations suggest placing firebreaks around British banks’ retail operations. Compliance Action Principal Weighs Leaving Savings and Loan Status Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the seller of life insurance and retirement products, is weighing an exit from its status as a savings and loan holding company to limit U.S. oversight. The insurer filed a draft application to change its status to avoid Federal Reserve regulation that may limit investing and require the Des Moines, Iowa-based company to hold additional capital. The company may operate its Principal Bank as a limited purpose trust institution, which would still hold savings products in individual retirement accounts and be supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principal said. The bank operates online with no physical branches and Principal isn’t now seeking a buyer for the unit, said Susan Houser, a company spokeswoman. “Some of the Dodd-Frank provisions, such as the Volcker rule, along with the unknowns of new capital requirements, could have an outsized impact on Principal relative to any benefit of Fed regulation,” Chief Executive Officer Larry Zimpleman said on a Nov. 27 conference call with analysts. Principal follows MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, in moving to limit oversight. American International Group Inc. (AIG) is weighing a similar move, and Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) , Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) , and Allstate Corp. (ALL) have all retreated from the banking business. “Principal will reduce the potential for restrictive regulatory oversight as a bank and may free up some capital over time,” Edward Shields, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, wrote in a research note. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, insurers with thrifts are subject to federal supervision -- including new capital standards -- that firms including MetLife have said are not suited to the industry. The Volcker rule limits proprietary trading and investing in private equity or hedge funds. The rules are intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 bailouts that the U.S. undertook as collapsing financial firms threatened the global economy. Fed regulation may have led to “reduced flexibility for our other asset-accumulation, mutual fund and asset management businesses,” Zimpleman said on the call. Principal’s bank had about $2.2 billion in deposits as of June 30 and 91 employees, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. The bank expects to hold about 85 percent of that sum after a change in status, Principal said. Filing a draft application will allow the insurer to work with the Fed to understand requirements for deregistering as a savings and loan holding company, Houser said. If the draft application is on track, Principal will file a formal application, she added. Principal embraced the bank in June when the company said it benefits from the ability to hold customers’ government- insured deposits as the clients develop retirement plans. The deregistration process can take as little as a month or as long as a year, depending on the complexity, said Kevin L. Petrasic, a partner with law firm Paul Hastings LLP. MetLife, regulated as a bank-holding company, reached a deal last year to sell deposits to a unit of General Electric Co. to exit banking. The deal is still awaiting regulatory approval. The Fed has blocked MetLife’s plan to increase its dividend or resume share buybacks. Insurers “are very unhappy with being subject at a corporate level to bank-type capital regulations, including potential application of Basel III,” said Scott Harrington, director of the Risk and Insurance Program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “You have insurers that have invested significant resources in building these businesses, and now, if they sell off to a non-insurance entity, you have to presume they’re going to take a loss,” Harrington said. Compass Group’s Massoud to Pay $1.4 Million in SEC Insider Case A Connecticut-based investment manager will pay more than $1.4 million to settle regulatory claims that he illegally profited from inside information while working on the 2009 sale of Patriot Capital Funding Group. Compass Group Management Managing Partner Joseph Massoud, whose firm was involved in the bidding process, made about $676,000 on Patriot Capital shares he bought after gaining access to an online data room for bidders, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement Nov. 30. Massoud, 44, also agreed to be barred from the securities industry or serve as a public-company officer or director, the SEC said. Massoud bought 322,216 shares of Patriot Capital in transactions spread across 15 trading days from May to July of 2009, the SEC said. After the firm was acquired and the share price rose, Massoud sold all of the stock. “Mr. Massoud is pleased to have been able to resolve this personal trading matter,” Robert Anello, an attorney for Massoud, said in a statement. “He has helped build significant value for shareholders and investors over the last 15 years and looks forward to future endeavors.” ASX Offers Customers Trading, Clearing Revenue Rebate From 2013 ASX Ltd. (ASX) , the operator of Australia ’s main stock exchange, will share with its customers 50 percent of revenue growth from trading in cash equities and clearing starting Jan. 1 in a bid to maintain market share. ASX revenue growth through the end of June 2014 will be shared 50-50 with customers and will be proportionate to each of its customers contribution, according to a letter dated Nov. 28 from ASX Chief Executive Officer Elmer Funke Kupper and sent to clients. All participants are eligible for rebates and the threshold will be reviewed after 2014, the letter said. Traditional exchanges worldwide are losing market share to so called dark pools and other alternative trading venues, such as Chi-X Australia Pty, which last year started operating as Australia’s sole stock-exchange competitor. As part of the Australian government’s attempt to increase its presence as a financial hub by opening up Asia-Pacific’s fourth-largest equity market, the country is considering whether or not to allow ASX to maintain its monopoly over the clearing and settlement of trades. The offer will operate for at least the coming three to five years, Funke Kupper wrote. RBS to Close Indian Division After Sale to HSBC Collapses Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, said the sale of its Indian consumer and commercial-banking operations to HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) collapsed. RBS will wind down the unit, the 81 percent taxpayer-owned bank said in a statement Nov. 30. RBS announced the sale to London-based HSBC for an undisclosed sum in July 2010. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King is pressuring U.K. banks to raise capital levels by selling assets to guard against loan losses. Banks are struggling to find buyers for assets: in October, Banco Santander SA (SAN) walked away from buying 316 branches that RBS has to sell by 2014 to comply with a European Union state-aid ruling after being bailed out by U.K. taxpayers. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester has cut assets by more than 800 billion pounds ($1.28 trillion), eliminated 36,000 jobs and scaled back RBS’s securities and Irish units since 2008. RBS’s Indian unit has about 190 million pounds of assets, 31 branches and serves 400,000 customers, the bank said. HSBC said in a separate statement that it remained committed to the Indian market and would expand there through its existing operations. UBS Said to Be Close to Reaching a Settlement Over Libor-Rigging UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest lender, is close to agreements with regulators to pay more than 290 million pounds ($465 million) to settle allegations traders tried to rig global interest rates, a person with knowledge of the talks said. An announcement may come as soon as next week, said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks are private. More than 25 people have already left UBS after the lender’s own internal probe, another person said last month. Global authorities are investigating claims that more than a dozen banks altered submissions used to set benchmark such as the London interbank offered rate to profit from bets on interest-rate derivatives or make the lenders’ finances appear healthier. “UBS has been cooperating fully with the regulatory and enforcement authorities in connection with Libor investigations,” Mark Panday, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at the Zurich-based lender, said in an e-mail, declining to comment further because of ongoing discussions with authorities. Regulators are focusing on whether UBS traders colluded with other banks to influence rates in an effort to increase profit, the person said. For more, click here. EU Says It Won’t Meet January Deadline to Implement Basel III The European Union won’t be ready to legally implement Basel III bank rules by the start of the year, Stefaan De Rynck, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in Brussels today. “The legal entry into force of CRD IV is no longer realistic for January 2013,” he said, referring to the EU’s draft law to apply the Basel capital and liquidity rules. Any delay should be as “short as possible,” he said. FBI Informant Led Agents on Insider Chase From Galleon to SAC David Slaine, a former Morgan Stanley managing director and ex-partner at the Galleon Group LLC hedge fund, told the FBI that a money manager he knew paid off people to find out who used Teterboro airport in New Jersey. The small New Jersey airport is located close to many of the world’s biggest drug companies. The trader was using the information to profit quietly on trades of health-care stocks. The bribed tipsters were watching for bankers who “were coming in and out of Teterboro Airport,” agent David Makol wrote in a summary of Slaine’s Aug. 18, 2007, conversation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, one of more than 200 they had with him. “All the major players involved in the pharmaceutical industry would come in and out of that airport.” During the U.S. crackdown on insider trading over the past five years, Slaine, 53, became a tip-mining machine as he worked undercover, often wired for sound under FBI orders, from mid- 2007 until at least June 2009. The government’s most productive informant in a broad investigation of Wall Street insider trading, he was also among the first to cooperate. His work led directly to the conviction of 12 people and indirectly to a half-dozen more. His leads helped prosecutors win judicial permission to wiretap the mobile phone of Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam , who was later convicted. U.S. agents used evidence he gathered to build cases leading to executives at expert-networking firm Primary Global Research LLC. He passed information about Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP, and he took the witness stand to tell jurors about secret recordings he made of traders now in prison. An examination of Slaine’s work with the FBI, based on hundreds of documents never before revealed, shows how the bureau turned Slaine, how his cooperation deepened, how his information created a domino effect of new investigations and new informants, and how the case took a personal toll on Slaine.

Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Lyxor’s investments with SAC are very limited, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Officials for Lyxor and Societe Generale in Paris declined to comment, while a spokesman for Stamford , Connecticut-based SAC didn’t answer the phone outside of business hours. The Wall Street Journal reported on Lyxor’s plans late yesterday. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told SAC that it is considering suing the $14 billion hedge fund for fraud involving alleged insider trading by former portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, who was arrested in November, three people with knowledge of the matter said last month. SAC received the warning in November, Tom Conheeney, the firm’s president, told investors on a Nov. 28 conference call during which the firm discussed Martoma’s arrest. Cohen, who spoke briefly during the call, said he acted appropriately when he traded shares of two drugmakers four years ago on recommendations from Martoma, according to two of the people. “Mr. Cohen and SAC are confident that they have acted appropriately and will continue to cooperate with the government’s inquiry,” a spokesman for SAC Capital said last month in an e-mailed statement. Cohen hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing. Martoma’s lawyer, Charles Stillman, said in an e-mailed statement last month that he expected Martoma to be fully exonerated. Courts SEC Claims Chicago Private Equity Fund Manager Misled Investors The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Resources Planning Group, a Chicago-based investment adviser, and one of its owners, over claims they raised money for a failing private- equity fund to pay off existing clients. Joseph Hennessy collected more than $1.3 million from 2007 to 2010 on false claims that a fund he helped run was viable, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed last week at U.S. District Court in Illinois. Hennessy used at least $641,000 to make partial payments to customers holding promissory notes that he had personally guaranteed, the SEC said. James Kopecky, a lawyer for RPG, said in an interview that the firm will fight the SEC’s claims. “Resources Planning Group is a clean shop with no disciplinary history, and they cater to investors who know what they’re doing,” Kopecky said. The SEC has stepped up its scrutiny of the private-equity business following the 2008 financial market turmoil which forced firms to write down the value of their holdings. After the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act authorized greater oversight of money managers, the agency initiated a broad review of practices at private-equity and hedge funds, including how assets are valued and claims of unusually high performance. Kevin Flynn, an attorney for Hennessy, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the allegations. The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Resources Planning Group, Inc., 12-cv-09509, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois ( Chicago ). To contact the reporter on this story: Carla Main in New Jersey at  cmain2@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "U.S. Wind Turbine Market Forecast Cut By 23% By MAKE", "article": "Wind turbine installations will grow more slowly in the U.S., the world’s second-largest market, because of an “unfavorable” policy environment and “adverse” macro-economic conditions, MAKE Consulting said. Little or no growth is expected this year in the U.S., the Hoejbjerg, Denmark-based consultant said today on its website. MAKE Consulting lowered its forecast for wind turbine installations in the U.S. by 23 percent from 2010 to 2015. “The slow recovery of the U.S. economy coupled with continued weakness in natural gas prices has provided a headwind for U.S. wind turbine sales,” the industry consultant said. “After years of strong growth, the U.S. wind energy market is bracing itself for a precipitous drop in annual turbine installations.” Prices of natural gas, an energy source that complements wind energy, continue to be “weak,” hurting wind turbine sales, MAKE said. In addition, efforts by some U.S. governors to revive federal legislation for renewable energy will probably not result in more funding, the consultant added. Turbine installations in the U.S. may fall to 6 gigawatts this year from about 9 gigawatts in 2009, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in August. Manufacturers of wind equipment are operating at 25 percent less than than full capacity, and poor demand is leading to lower prices for new orders. Shares of Clipper Windpower Plc , the London-traded wind- turbine manufacturer, yesterday sank 30 percent after it said “significant” strain on its cash position is creating a “material uncertainty” about the company’s operations. Vestas Wind Systems A/S sank for a fifth day in Copenhagen trading.

{"headline": "Hana Financial Open to Insurer Acquisition, Chairman Kim Says", "article": "Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , which completed South Korea ’s biggest banking takeover last month, will seek to buy an insurer to shore up its existing business, Chairman Kim Jung Tai said. “Insurance is the weakest part among Hana Financial Group’s operations,” Kim told reporters today in Seoul in his first briefing since taking over this week. “We have interest in that area and will look into it when good opportunities arise.” Kim ruled out a bid for ING Groep NV’s Asian insurance unit, saying the competition is already tough. Kim, 60, said he aims to make Hana Financial one of the top 50 banks in the world, ranked by assets, by 2015. Hana is also open to acquisitions of small U.S. banks as it seeks growth beyond its saturated home market, he said, without identifying potential takeover targets or specifying regions where Hana wants to expand. Kim began his career at SeoulBank, joining Hana Bank in 1992 and becoming president and CEO of the subsidiary in March 2008. He served as CEO of Hana’s brokerage unit from 2006 to 2007, according to a profile posted on the company’s website. As chairman and chief executive officer of the group he succeeds Kim Seung Yu, who retired on March 23. KEB Integration Kim Jung Tai will work as a “helper” and “adviser” on the integration of Korea Exchange Bank (004940) with Hana, the nation’s fourth-largest financial holding company, following legal disputes, regulatory delays and opposition from KEB workers that delayed the 4.4 trillion-won ($3.9 billion) takeover for more than a year. Hana on Feb. 9 completed the acquisition of a 57 percent stake in KEB from Lone Star Funds and Export Import Bank of Korea , allowing the company to narrow the gap with rivals such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000) and KB Financial Group Inc. (105560)  The deal, first signed in November 2010, was hampered by courts, regulators and lawmakers, derailing Dallas-based Lone Star’s exit from its 2003 investment in KEB. Employees of KEB criticized Hana’s acquisition of the lender from Lone Star , saying it helped the U.S. fund make excessive profit. Hana on Feb. 17 agreed with KEB workers to keep the bank independent for next five years and keep the same number of staff to assuage workers who pledged to “fight with all possible means” including strikes.

{"headline": "Asian Currencies Drop as Stocks Decline on U.S. Data", "article": "(Corrects losing streak for ringgit in fifth paragraph.) Asian currencies declined, led by Malaysia’s ringgit and the Indian rupee , as regional stocks fell on concern U.S. economic growth is cooling. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of equities slid after reports from the U.S. yesterday showed service industries expanded at the slowest pace in eight months and companies added fewer jobs than forecast. The U.S. government will announce official employment data tomorrow. “Global risk sentiment is being driven by recent economic data that may favor safe-haven currencies in the very short term,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “Asian currency markets may consolidate in a tight range ahead of non-farm payrolls data tomorrow.” The ringgit weakened 0.5 percent to 2.9914 per dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur and India ’s rupee fell 0.3 percent to 44.59. Singapore’s dollar dropped 0.2 percent to S$1.2314, Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 8,568 and the Philippine peso retreated 0.2 percent to 42.94. The ringgit declined for a third day, its longest losing streak since February. Bank Negara will keep its overnight policy rate at 2.75 percent today, according to nine of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, while seven predict an increase to 3 percent. ‘If the U.S. recovery is deemed to be somewhat derailed momentarily, it could support a case for a hold on interest rates ,’’ Saktiandi said. “We see a higher probability of an increase in the second half” in Malaysia , he said. Philippine Inflation The Philippines peso fell as a government report showed the fastest pace of inflation in two years in April. Consumer prices increased 4.5 percent from a year earlier, after a 4.3 percent gain in March. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 4.4 percent gain. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased its benchmark rate for a second consecutive meeting to 4.50 percent, matching a forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. “The market may be pricing in uncertainty on inflation,” said Lito Biacora, vice president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in Manila. “The weakness in the U.S. economy and correction in the equities market” are driving the peso lower, he said. Indonesian Rate Decision The rupiah dropped as a government report today showed a 6.5 percent rise in first-quarter gross domestic product from a year earlier, compared with a 6.89 percent gain in the three months through December. The first-quarter number was lower than the 6.58 percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Bank Indonesia will leave its policy rate at 6.75 percent next week, according to all eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg. “The rupiah’s weakening is driven by external factors,” said Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea- Chinese Banking Corp. “As long as the GDP numbers come in above 6 percent, there will be positive momentum for the economy.” Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$28.632 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.

{"headline": "CFTC Proposal for Swaps Margin May Apply to Futures", "article": "(Corrects to remove references to interest income in first, fourth, fifth, ninth and final paragraphs for story published April 14.) The Commodity Futures Trading Commission may require margin changes in futures markets that are being considered for new swaps clearing plans. The CFTC has proposed divvying up margin payments of individual swaps users at clearinghouses rather than allowing accounts to be treated as one pool by banks representing multiple customers. Futures markets now allow banks to pool all their customer accounts together when settling a day’s margins. The swaps plan may be used for futures margin, too, said CFTC Commissioner Scott O’Malia. “It’s being considered,” he said in an interview yesterday. Futures brokerages such as Newedge USA LLC and MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) invest excess collateral that they hold overnight to earn interest on U.S. Treasuries and other investments. While benchmark U.S. interest rates are between zero and 0.25 percent, offering little earning opportunity now, higher-rate environments can provide large earnings opportunities for futures brokers. MF Global, for instance, earned $1.77 billion in interest income in the quarter ended March 31, 2007 when rates were 5.25 percent. MF Global’s interest income includes returns it earns on investments it makes with its own capital, according to the company. Proposed Rule The CFTC proposed rule states that customers of brokerages such as Newedge or MF Global must have their margin treated on a “gross basis” equal to the amount of cash to back trades that would be required if the customer was a member of the clearinghouse. A clearinghouse “would not be permitted to net positions of different customers against one another,” according to the rule. The commission hasn’t issued a final rule on the margin issue. Comments on the proposal were closed to public input March 21. Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman at MF Global, and Emily Ahearn, a spokeswoman for Newedge, didn’t immediately return calls for comment. As of Feb. 28, futures brokerages held $163.7 billion in customer margin, according to monthly reports by the CFTC.

{"headline": "Cook Bets Apple Will Avoid Fate of Slower-Growth Peers", "article": "(Corrects amount of Apple’s cash in second paragraph of story that ran March 20.) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is betting that his company can keep cranking out best- selling gadgets even while paying a dividend, avoiding the fate of peers that return money to investors yet grow more slowly. Cook said yesterday that Apple will dip in to its $97.6 billion in cash and investments to pay investors $2.65 a quarter for each share owned. The Cupertino, California-based company also instituted a $10 billion share-buyback program. Dividends are often associated with companies that have matured past a rapid-growth phase and get more mileage from returning cash to shareholders than using it to generate innovative products, said Lee Pinkowitz, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University in Washington. Apple, with a steady flow of electronics that have transformed the way people compute and communicate, is an exception, he said. “There is this view that dividends are an admission of defeat,” said Pinkowitz. “Apple is unique. It has gotten to that point as a victim of its own success. They have so much cash and are making it faster than they could spend.” Apple boosted sales 68 percent in calendar 2011, compared with 2 percent at AT&T Inc. (T) , 8 percent at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and a decline at General Electric Co. (GE) All pay dividends. While Apple is more than 30 years old, it has undergone rapid growth in recent years after the introductions of the iPhone and iPad. Since the iPhone debuted in January 2007, the stock has risen more than sevenfold. The company’s cash pile grew by 62 percent last year alone. Growth, Plus Dividends Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is attempting to heed investors’ concerns that it was hoarding too much cash while avoiding the perception that it’s no longer a growth company, said Giri Cherukuri , a portfolio manager at Oakbrook Investments LLC, which holds Apple shares. “It’s big enough to satisfy investors and for Apple to continue to maintain that it’s a growth company,” said Cherukuri. Cook said Apple will continue to thrive by expanding abroad, adding new business users and adding new customers for its line of Mac computers. “We don’t see a ceiling” for the company’s growth prospects, Cook said on a conference call yesterday. Surging global demand for smartphones will result in continued growth for the iPhone, Apple’s top-selling product, while the iPad is the market-leader in tablet sales, he said. The Mac business is outperforming the broader market, and Apple is building an enterprise sales force to lure new business users, Cook said. ‘Extremely Confident’ “The growth speaks for itself,” Cook said on the call. “I am extremely confident in our future. The pipeline is full of stuff and I think our customers are going to be incredibly pleased with what they see coming out.” Analysts predict Apple’s shares will continue to rise. At least four analysts have increased their price targets for Apple to $700 or higher in recent weeks. Morgan Keegan yesterday raised its price target for Apple to $800. Apple climbed to a record $601.10 yesterday in New York , leaving the year-to-date gain at 48 percent. The buyback and dividend will cost Apple about $45 billion over three years. Even so, the company will be adding about $30 billion in cash per year to its balance sheet , according to Toni Sacconaghi , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Apple may have more than $200 billion at its disposal by 2015, he said. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs , who died in October, had long resisted calls to return some of the money to shareholders , saying that the company was keeping its “powder dry” in case an opportunity emerged. Temptation to Waste Cook, after taking over as CEO, signaled more willingness to listen to shareholders and said earlier this year that Apple had more money that it needed to run the business. Apple’s dividend was “inevitable” and its size will likely grow as the company adds more cash to its balance sheet, said Harry DeAngelo, professor of finance at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He said linking a dividend with a company’s growth prospects is an “inappropriate way of framing” the issue. “The cash influxes are so huge that at some point you have to ask does it make sense to keep accumulating their cash internally,” DeAngelo said. “The answer is an unequivocally no. When too much cash builds up, there becomes a temptation to waste it.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Satariano in San Francisco at  asatariano1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "애플이 배당금을 지급하면서도 성장세를 유지할 수 있는 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "배당이 기업의 성장 전망에 대한 부정적인 신호로 여겨지는 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "기업이 배당과 자사주 매입을 결정하는 과정에서 고려해야 할 요인은 무엇인가?"}]}

Haslingden, 50, who has served as president of Fox Networks since January 2011, plans to spend more time with his family, News Corp. said today in a statement. “My family is by far my greatest love, and being away from them for almost two years is long enough,” Haslingden said in the statement. “I’m delighted to be on my way home.” News Corp. has made a number of executive changes since announcing in June plans to split into separate publishing and entertainment businesses. The company, led by Rupert Murdoch , named Peter Rice chairman and chief executive officer of its television business and moved David Hill from the head of Fox Sports to a senior role in the corporate office in July. Haslingden, who reported to Rice, helped expand News Corp.’s international TV business to more than 350 channels in over 55 countries, the company said. He oversaw business development, finance, legal, ad sales and corporate functions, according to the January 2011 announcement of his appointment. “Since joining News Corporation, David has been a driving force in the evolution of the pay-TV industry in every corner of the world,” Chase Carey , News Corp.’s president and chief operating officer, said in the statement.

{"headline": "Airlines Risk Deeper Seat Cuts Amid U.S. Wealth ‘Destruction’", "article": "U.S. airlines may have to cut back on flying as the slowing economy erodes their ability to boost fares while they struggle with higher costs for jet fuel. That squeeze “calls for contraction,” said Hunter Keay , an analyst at New York-based Wolfe Trahan & Co. A benchmark of fuel-refining expenses rose to record highs last week, adding to pressure on carriers to match Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) in paring current capacity or future growth. Consumer confidence tumbled this month to the lowest since 1980, stoking concern that Americans will curb spending. That gauge of public sentiment on Aug. 12 followed record swings in U.S. stocks as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index whipsawed to gains or losses of at least 4.4 percent for four straight days. “I don’t think airlines should view that nervousness as short term,” Keay said in an interview. “If executives are going to go out and assume high fuel prices are here to stay, then they should assume that fear and destruction of consumer wealth are here indefinitely as well.” Airlines have raised fares across most of their domestic networks at least eight times in 2011, and had projected that a recovering economy would allow more increases. Those expectations are crumbling after three failures in the industry’s last four attempts to ratchet up prices. ‘Very Clear’ “It’s very clear the economy is not recovering,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in an interview. “Business travel, for one, won’t grow until the economy really does grow at a healthy rate.” Business fliers are the most lucrative for the industry, because they typically buy the most-expensive, last-minute tickets. The peak period for leisure travel ends with the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 5. “At some point, as companies look at a weak economy and weak consumer spending , they may pull back” on travel, said Philip Baggaley, an S&P debt analyst in New York. “It will be more difficult for the airlines to continue to raise prices.” That shifts airlines’ focus to chopping expenses. They can save money with steps such as reducing flight frequencies, dropping some routes and substituting smaller planes for larger aircraft. All those moves reduce available seating capacity, measured by the number of seats flown a mile. Slowing Economy U.S. economic expansion for 2011’s second half may be slower than analysts anticipated after growth in gross domestic product through June trailed forecasts, suggesting that “we are in for a business travel slowdown this fall,” Deutsche Bank AG’s Michael Linenberg in New York said in a report today. Investors soured on airlines even before the rout that erased $6.8 trillion in value from global equity markets from July 26 through Aug. 11. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index entered a bear market last month by tumbling 20 percent from its 2011 high. Its 33 percent drop this year outstripped the S&P 500’s 4.2 percent decline. While crude oil settled today at $87.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , 23 percent off the 2011 high, not all airlines benefit. Jet fuel averaged $3.08 a gallon this year through last week, 45 percent more than a year earlier. Crack Spread The pinch on airlines is worse when measured by the so- called crack spread between crude and heating oil. Many carriers use heating-oil futures to hedge their purchases of jet fuel, which doesn’t trade on the Nymex. The spread reached $37.45 a barrel on Aug. 10, the highest in 25 years of data compiled by Bloomberg, and has more than doubled this year. Delta CEO Richard Anderson told employees last week they shouldn’t be “fooled” by crude’s retreat. “The economy has many challenges, and we have no reason to think low fuel prices will stick,” he said. Atlanta-based Delta will pare capacity later this year as much as 5 percent, up from a planned 4 percent. Buyouts and early retirements this year helped the world’s second-largest airline eliminate more than 2,000 jobs, a spokesman, Eric Torbenson, said last month. Southwest, the biggest low-fare airline, trimmed capacity growth for 2011 to a range of 4 percent to 5 percent from as much as 6 percent. Seating on Dallas-based Southwest will be unchanged in 2012, and “possibly slightly down,” Kelly said. United, American United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , the largest airline company, has said its 2011 available seating would be unchanged. American Airlines , No. 3 in the U.S., has trimmed 2011 growth plans three times, to a goal of 1.9 percent. More adjustments in early 2012 are likely, according to the unit of Fort Worth , Texas-based AMR Corp. (AMR)  “Betting on discretionary travel is not a good bet right now,” said Robert Mann , a former executive at American who runs consultant R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington , New York. “It will come down to how corporate travel continues and how corporate profits look in the third quarter and fourth quarter.” Airlines are positioned to respond after slashing their flying amid the double whammy of record fuel prices in 2008 and business travel’s collapse in the recession, said John Heimlich, chief economist of the Air Transport Association , the industry’s Washington-based trade group. “Ever since then, it’s been a pretty watchful eye on continual refinement of the capacity dial,” Heimlich said in an interview. Filling Seats Airlines filled seats at rates running at or near company records through July. And demand is holding up at Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA) ’s Hawaiian Airlines, according to CEO Mark Dunkerley. “There’s clearly a view out there that the market contagion is going to spread into what people buy and how they go about their everyday lives,” Dunkerley said in an interview. “We’re certainly not seeing it.” Bond investors aren’t that optimistic. Delta’s 9.5 percent bonds due in September 2014 plummeted to the lowest since July 2010, Bloomberg data show. AMR’s 6.25 percent convertible bonds maturing in October 2014 slid to the lowest on record, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Keay, the Wolfe Trahan analyst, said an industry retrenchment would be inevitable. “Any capacity plan for 2012 is how much should be cut, not should it be cut,” he said. “All roads to success ultimately lead to capacity discipline.” To contact the reporters on this story: Mary Schlangenstein in Dallas at  maryc.s@bloomberg.net ; Mary Jane Credeur in Atlanta at  mcredeur@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at  edufner@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "항공 산업에서 비즈니스 여행객이 가장 수익성이 높은 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "항공사가 연료비 상승에 대응하기 위해 취할 수 있는 비용 절감 조치는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "항공 산업에서 경기 침체가 비즈니스 여행 수요에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?"}]}

{"headline": "House Prices Rise in 89% of U.S. Cities as Recovery Gains", "article": "Prices for single-family homes increased in 89 percent of U.S. cities in the first quarter as the housing market extends a recovery from a five-year slump. The median sales price rose from a year earlier in 133 of 150 metropolitan areas measured, the National Association of Realtors said in a report today. A year earlier, 74 areas had gains. Buyers returning to the housing market are bidding up prices for a tight supply of listings. The national median price for an existing single-family home was $176,600 in the first quarter, up 11.3 percent from the same period last year. That was the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2005, according to the Realtors group. “Some of the previously hard-hit markets like Phoenix, Sacramento and Miami continue to experience a dramatic turnaround, while a new set of areas like Atlanta, Minneapolis and Seattle have begun to show strong signs of upward momentum,” Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said in the report. At the end of the first quarter, 1.93 million previously owned homes were available for sale, 16.8 percent fewer than a year earlier, according to the Realtors group. The best-performing metro areas were Akron, Ohio, and San Francisco , where prices jumped 33 percent from a year earlier. Prices rose 32 percent in Reno, Nevada , and Silicon Valley, California ; 31 percent in Atlanta and 30 percent in Phoenix. Biggest Declines The Kankakee, Illinois, area had the biggest decline, falling 19 percent from a year earlier. Following were Edison, New Jersey , with a 8.6 percent drop, and Allentown, Pennsylvania , with a 8.3 percent decrease. The housing recovery is strengthening as the job market improves and the Federal Reserve pushes down borrowing costs for mortgages to near record lows. The unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.5 percent in April, according to Labor Department data, and the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest level in more than five years.

{"headline": "Prescription-Drug Abuse Is Focus of U.S. Drug-Control Strategy", "article": "The Obama administration will focus on curbing rates of drug abuse, particularly of prescription medications, among high-risk groups such as veterans and college students, the Office of National Drug Control Policy director said. The 2011 National Drug Control Strategy will expand its reach from last year’s report, while remaining focused on the ideas of prevention and treatment, director Gil Kerlikowske said. “Treatment is about half the cost of incarceration,” Kerlikowske said in a telephone interview, “so we think that in many ways, that makes a lot of sense.” Active-duty military and veterans, college students, and women and their dependent children will all be targeted in the updated strategy report released today. According to a fact sheet accompanying the report, cocaine abuse has fallen 46 percent over the last five years among young adults aged 18 to 25. Prescription drug abuse hasn’t seen the same decline, Kerlikowske said. “We’re seeing more initiation for drug use by young people through the medicine cabinet than through marijuana,” he said, adding that binge drinking is another pervasive problem for people in this age group. About 375,000 veterans were diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder in 2007, the fact sheet said. The 2011 strategy will encourage support for special courts designed for veterans with mental illness and substance issues, of which there are 60 nationwide, Kerlikowske said. Family-Based Treatment The administration’s latest plans will also include family- based treatment as an effective way of dealing with substance abuse among women. Women are being treated less frequently than men, a problem Kerlikowske attributed to their fear of being separated from their children either during treatment or permanently. The federal budget allocates about $26 billion toward drug abuse matters, with about half going to enforcement and half to prevention and treatment, Kerlikowske said. Funding for next year’s drug control strategy is subject to change as budget discussions continue.

{"headline": "Housing Market Failing to Clear: The Ticker", "article": "﻿The market isn’t doing a very good job of cleaning up after the housing bust, more evidence that this is a place where government intervention could help. Banks are taking ever longer to get houses through the foreclosure process, onto the market and into the hands of new owners. As of August, the average mortgage borrower in foreclosure hadn’t made a payment in 611 days, according to data provider LPS Applied Analytics. That's up from 599 in July and more than double the level of three years ago. The banks' slowness has various explanations. For one, problems with documentation have prompted them to hold off on foreclosure actions and even pull some loans back out of foreclosure. Beyond that, selling the homes would require them to fully recognize losses on the attached loans -- something many banks are reluctant to do. The longer the banks delay, the greater their losses are likely to be. As of August, some 38 percent of loans in the foreclosure process -- representing hundreds of thousands of houses -- hadn't been paid in more than two years. All those homes are stuck in a sort of twilight zone, either sitting empty or being exploited by nominal owners who have little incentive to invest in their upkeep. Many may already be worthless. Bloomberg View has advocated principal reductions on mortgage loans as a way to realign owners' and lenders' incentives, curb losses and clear the market. It would have been better to start before things got as bad as they have, but it's still not too late to make a difference.

{"headline": "Sulzer Names Wennemer Chairman Easing Vekselberg Domination Fear", "article": "Sulzer AG proposed former Continental AG chief executive officer Manfred Wennemer as chairman, easing concerns over the dominance of shareholder Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg , who is Russia’s second richest man, owns a 31.2 percent stake in Sulzer and 48.3 percent of OC Oerlikon AG, another Swiss engineering firm, through his Renova group of companies. Vekselberg’s opponents have accused him of trying to merge the two firms. “There was a concern regarding a Renova-dependent person becoming chairman,” said Fabian Haecki, an analyst with Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich said by email. “Hence, this move is positive in my view. He is very experienced indeed and independent.” Sulzer’s board of directors unanimously voted for Wennemer, who is independent and not a Vekselberg representative, company spokesman Thomas Gerlach said. Wennemer, who will replace Juergen Dormann , worked for auto-parts maker Continental from 1994 to 2008 including a seven year stint as CEO, during which time the company’s market value rose to 12 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros as he expanded the product range and made acquisitions. From 2011 to 2012 he was chairman of the supervisory board of Hochtief AG. Dormann, 73, chairman since 2009, is stepping down because of internal age-limitation rules. Shares Soar Sulzer CEO Klaus Stahlmann, who joined from MAN SE a year ago, presided over a 44 percent share gain last year as orders for pumps to supply the oil and gas industry boomed from the U.S. to Russia. That compared to a 15 percent rise in the Swiss Market Index. Sulzer today reported full-year earnings before interest and taxes of 410 million Swiss francs ($444.5 million), meeting the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 12 percent to a record 4.02 billion francs, beating the average estimate of 3.95 billion francs. Sulzer confirmed its mid-term targets. Emerging markets and North America are likely to remain the growth drivers for the company, it said in a statement. The Winterthur, Switzerland- based firm proposed a dividend of 3.20 francs a share, beating a Bloomberg forecast of 3 francs. Sulzer forecast “moderate” growth for orders and sales this year. “Further growth is expected for parts of the oil and gas and for the water markets in 2013,” the company said. “Activities in the power and the transportation industries are forecast to continue at similar levels.” To contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Winters in Zurich at  pwinters3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Thiel at  sthiel1@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "Sulzer AG의 이사회는 왜 Manfred Wennemer를 의장으로 선출했나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "Viktor Vekselberg의 영향력이 Sulzer AG에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "Sulzer AG의 성장 전략과 관련하여, 신흥 시장과 북미 지역의 중요성은 무엇인가요?"}]}
{"headline": "Spain’s NH Hoteles Cuts Price of Shares for HNA Deal by 24%", "article": "NH Hoteles SA (NHH) , Spain’s largest business hotel chain, said China ’s HNA Group Co. Ltd. will pay 24 percent less than previously agreed to take a 20 percent stake in the company, increasing chances of the deal being completed. Hainan-based HNA will pay 5.35 euros per share for 61.7 million new NH shares compared with 7 euros per share set in May, NH said in a regulatory filing today. Madrid-based NH Hoteles jumped 48 cents, or 15 percent to 3.74 euros, its biggest gain since May 10, 2010. The shares have lost 36 percent since the deal was announced in May this year. “Markets were doubting the transaction would take place at all given the slide in the share price since the original offer was made,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at Interbrokers in Barcelona , Spain. “A more attractive price will ensure the deal will go through.” The deal will raise 329.85 million euros ($455 million) for NH, compared with 431.6 million euros under the terms of the previous agreement. HNA, an air-transport and tourism company controlled by the government of Hainan province is acquiring the stake as part of an agreement that will see the companies create a joint venture in China and NH become the preferred hotel for clients traveling with HNA. The capital increase, which will allow HNA to become the hotelier’s second-biggest shareholder behind Grupo Inversor Hesperia SA, will have to be exercised before Dec. 15, according to the statement. Spanish Revenue NH Hoteles has 400 hotels in 25 countries. About a quarter of the company’s second-quarter revenue came from Spain , which is struggling to emerge from the deepest recession in six decades as austerity measures undermine the recovery. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is trying to encourage Chinese investment in Spain and Spanish companies to boost exports to the Asian nation and visited China in April to improve ties between the countries.

{"headline": "Hertz Bid For Dollar Thrifty Runs Into Headwinds at FTC", "article": "Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s bid for antitrust clearance to buy Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. has met resistance at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, according to people familiar with the situation. An understanding that the deal could be approved with conditions, reached with the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, faces opposition at the agency’s Bureau of Economics, where some staffers think the $2.6 billion merger should be blocked, said the people, who declined to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The two bureaus submit their recommendations to the five-member commission, which makes the final decision. Hertz, based in Park Ridge, New Jersey, announced the acquisition on Aug. 26 and it said it expected FTC approval by mid-October. On Oct. 18, Hertz extended the deadline for the FTC to rule on the transaction to Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the agency needed more time to complete its review. “We’re maybe at the last hour, and now the FTC apparently wants to look at more information,” Fred Lowrance, a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst at Avondale Partners LLC, said in an interview. “It’s a little surprising and frustrating that the process continues to drag on this long.” Hertz, which has sought to take over Dollar Thrifty (DTG) for more than five years, agreed to sell its Advantage brand to address FTC concerns that the deal would crimp competition in the rental-car market, the people said. Shares Fall Dollar Thrifty, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma , fell 6.3 percent to $79.24 in New York trading, the biggest drop since August 2011. Hertz dropped 4.5 percent to $13.67, the biggest decline since July 24. Hertz offered Dollar Thrifty investors $87.50 a share. The difference between the offer price and Dollar Thrifty’s stock price widened to $8.26 from 28 cents on Sept. 4, a sign risk arbitrage investors are less confident the deal will get done. Cecelia Prewett, an FTC spokeswoman, declined to comment on the status of the agency’s review. Richard Broome, a Hertz spokesman, also declined to comment. Hertz began its pursuit of Dollar Thrifty in April 2007. In 2010, it made a formal bid of about $1.2 billion, which Dollar Thrifty shareholders rejected. Another offer last year was withdrawn as a result of market conditions, the company said. As part of the latest agreement to buy Tulsa, Oklahoma- based Dollar Thrifty, Hertz committed to selling its Advantage brand to Franchise Services of North America Inc. (FSN) and Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Macquarie Capital. FTC Probe FTC investigators are continuing to interview competitors about the deal’s potential impact, while Howard Shelanski, the new director of the Bureau of Economics, is reviewing the case and hasn’t submitted his office’s formal recommendation to the commission, the people said. The Bureau of Economics’ position could be more influential than usual because of Shelanski, who is both an economist and a lawyer, the people said. Shelanski, who was nominated to the post in May, is also a law professor at Georgetown University. He previously served at the FTC as deputy director of the Bureau of Economics from 2009-2011 and is highly respected within the agency, the people said. Lawyers for both Hertz and the FTC have started preparing for litigation in case the FTC sues to block the deal, one of the people said. Under its merger agreement with Dollar Thrifty , Hertz is obliged to do everything it can to conclude the takeover, including litigating against any injunction or other attempt to block the deal. More Questions A non-voting meeting of the agency’s commissioners last week yielded more questions about the transaction, the people said. A final decision requires the votes of three of the agency’s five commissioners. “Until the commission decides, there may be a lot of information that keeps coming to light and keeps getting looked at,” said Roxann Henry, a partner with Morrison Foerster LLP in Washington. “After two years, they are going to make certain they have all the facts and don’t get it wrong.” Some regulators at the FTC are concerned consumers will be hurt particularly at airport locations by further concentration in the industry, the people said. Market Players If the Dollar Thrifty deal is approved, the U.S. rental-car industry will have shrunk in the past half-decade from five major companies to three, highlighted by Enterprise Holdings Inc.’s 2007 acquisition of Vanguard Car Rental Group Inc., owner of the National and Alamo brands. The four largest companies -- Enterprise, Hertz, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR) and Dollar Thrifty -- control 80 percent of the U.S. market, according to market researcher IBISWorld. The number of U.S. rental-car locations has fallen to 17,037 this year from a peak of 17,331 in 2007, IBISWorld said in a report on the U.S. market in February. That number will decline to 16,878 by 2017, Santa Monica, California-based IBISWorld estimates. “Companies will only need to give the commission more time when there are unresolved issues,” said William Vigdor, an antitrust lawyer with Vinson & Elkins LLP in Washington, who served at the FTC for six years. “Clearly the jury is still out on whether the transaction will be approved.” To contact the reporters on this story: Sara Forden in Washington at  sforden@bloomberg.net ; Mark Clothier in Southfield, Michigan at  mclothier@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Lithuanian Government Sees Faster Inflation, Reversing a Deflation Call", "article": "Lithuanian consumer prices will probably rise this year because of higher commodity and food prices, the Finance Ministry said, reversing an earlier forecast for deflation.  The inflation rate will average 1.1 percent this year, compared with a May 13 forecast of 0.1 percent deflation, the Vilnius-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. Consumer prices will average 1.8 percent next year. The government reiterated its economic growth forecast of 1.6 percent for this year and 2.8 percent in 2011.  Inflation in the Baltic nation was the fastest in 10 months in July at 1.9 percent. Lithuania, which maintains a fixed exchange rate for the litai to the euro, has been using deflation and wage cuts to restore competitiveness after a credit-fueled boom led the European Union’s second-worst recession last year.  Prices will accelerate on “a depreciating euro rate against the dollar, higher global oil and food prices and also changing compensation trends,” the ministry said. The inflation rate is expected to jump to 2.5 percent by the end of the year, it said.  Wages rose 1.2 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months for the first time since 2008 as the economy began to recover and emigration trimmed the workforce.  Economic growth may accelerate to between 4 percent and 5 percent in the second half this year on export growth and “stabilization of domestic demand,” the ministry said.  Output returned to growth last quarter, driven by foreign sales and industrial production. Gross domestic product advanced 1.3 percent from a year ago after a 2.8 percent contraction in the first quarter.

{"headline": "PBOC’s Zhou Says Slower Growth Needed for Restructuring", "article": "China’s slower expansion in the first quarter is “normal” as the world’s second-largest economy sacrifices growth to make structural reforms, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said. While a “mild” global slowdown is affecting China, the 7.7 percent gain was “overall normal” compared with the government’s 2013 target of 7.5 percent, Zhou told Bloomberg News outside a meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington on April 20. Investors are assessing where the nation’s growth rate may settle as the working-age population declines, costs rise and officials wrestle with the environmental toll from polluting factories. A sustained shift to a lower-growth gear will affect everything from the outlook for the world’s automobile makers to iron-ore demand in Australia as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) predicts expansion will moderate toward 6 percent later this decade. “We should appreciate and get used to this new normal of slower growth which has seen a stable job market and moderate inflation pressures,” said Chang Jian, a Hong Kong-based economist at Barclays Plc who formerly worked for the World Bank. She sees an annual rate in the 6 percent to 8 percent range over the next 10 years. Expansion in the first quarter missed the 8 percent median of economists’ forecasts and slowed from 7.9 percent in the previous three months, when Asia’s biggest economy emerged from a seven-quarter slowdown. Premier Li Keqiang this month urged more efforts to improve the quality and benefits of economic development as the government seeks to shift away from an export-reliant model. Growth ‘Sacrifice’ “China’s undergoing economic restructuring, which sometimes is not in lockstep with growth,” Zhou said. “We need to sacrifice short-term growth for the purposes of reforms and structural adjustments.” Asian stocks climbed today, led by Japan, as the absence of opposition to Japanese stimulus efforts at a Group of 20 meeting in Washington bolstered the outlook for that nation’s economy and demand in the region. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent as of 1:29 p.m. in Tokyo. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 percent after an April 20 earthquake that killed at least 188 people. China’s economy had a stable start in the first quarter and growth was within a reasonable range, Zhou said at the IMF meeting, according to a statement on the PBOC’s website. Government Power Premier Li pledged in March to open the economy to more market forces and strip power from the government as part of efforts to restructure. State-owned companies and the country’s new wealthy class may stand as barriers after benefiting from controls on borrowing and savings rates, underpriced resources and the absence of property taxes. PBOC Deputy Governor Yi Gang said April 17 in Washington that the yuan ’s trading band will widen “in the near future,” and that China needs to make its capital account fully convertible. Revamping the value-added tax system for businesses is a priority in fiscal reforms, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said last week in Washington. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) last week cut their estimates for China’s 2013 expansion to 7.8 percent. That would be the same as 2012’s pace which was the weakest in 13 years. Asia, Europe Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan’s jobless rate rose in March, a report showed today. Euro-area consumer confidence worsened in April, the European Commission is forecast to say today. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s national activity index may show a lower reading in March compared with February, while the National Association of Realtors is expected to say sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose last month to the highest in more than three years, according to Bloomberg surveys. In China, “structural adjustment has scored notable achievements,” according to a PBOC statement. The contribution of service industries to economic growth in the first quarter exceeded that of manufacturing for the first time, it said. In his statement to the IMF, Zhou reiterated that changes in China’s financial sector will involve “further interest-rate liberalization, capital account convertibility and exchange rate reform.” While inflation has been “relatively stable,” the government remains on guard due to rising costs for labor and raw materials, pricing reforms and excessive global liquidity, Zhou said. March consumer prices increased 2.1 percent from a year earlier, after rising 3.2 percent in February which was the quickest pace in 10 months.

{"headline": "Airplanes Fly as Mail Delivered Even If Government Shuts", "article": "Planes will still fly and land safely with the aid of federal air-traffic controllers even if Congress can’t reach a deal to fund the federal government. FBI agents will investigate crimes, mail will be delivered, Social Security checks and Medicare payments will go out and U.S. military personnel will still report to duty. That camping trip to Yosemite? Try a staycation instead as national parks will probably close. The effects of a government shutdown may not be immediately apparent to most Americans should Congress fail to fund operations by Oct. 1. In a protracted shutdown, though, the effects could prove to be far-reaching. “There will be a noticeable lack of people to do the things that most people take for granted, and will be quite irritating if they don’t happen,” said Scott Lilly, a budget specialist at the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based group that says it promotes progressive political ideas. Irritations may include unanswered tax-filing questions, said Lilly, a former Democratic aide to the House Appropriations Committee. While Social Security checks will be issued, new claims and address changes might not get processed, he said. Life, Property Jobs deemed “excepted” from the shutdown, because they help protect life and property, or are funded by programs not subject to annual appropriations, would go on. President Barack Obama will issue an order that determines what federal jobs are critical, Lilly said. In the past, air traffic controllers have been retained, while passport offices have been closed. Mail delivery, which is funded by the sale of postage, would continue under a shutdown. Veterans groups say they worry the backlog of disability claims will grow in a shutdown. The processing may “come to a screeching halt,” Ray Kelley, legislative director for the Kansas City, Missouri-based Veterans of Foreign Wars, said by telephone. About 800,000 of the almost 2 million federal workers at agencies funded under annual appropriations could be furloughed, said J. David Cox, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents about 650,000 people. The 2 million workers don’t include active military personnel or Postal Service employees. Sixth Showdown The budget impasse marks the sixth fiscal showdown between Democrats and Republicans since 2011. The Republican-led House passed and sent to the Senate legislation Sept. 20 to fund the government that includes language blocking implementation of the 2010 health law. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said the chamber won’t pass a bill defunding Obama’s signature legislative achievement. One risk from the impasse is the further diminution in the eyes of the public about the efficacy of Washington politicians, said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. “It plays into the hands of those that say the government can’t do anything right,” Hoagland said by telephone. Government agencies are dusting off contingency plans assembled in late 2011 in the event a compromise isn’t reached. Those plans show that some agencies would be affected more than others because of exemptions written into the law. The Justice Department, for example, estimated in 2011 that more than 94,000 of its 117,579 employees would be retained because a “significant portion” of its mission involves protection of “human life and property.” Eric Holder Even so, Attorney General Eric Holder said at a news briefing today that a shutdown would be, “something very bad,” and would affect operations at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. “I would hope that what I think I would characterize as the dysfunction that I see up on the hill might in some way, somehow be resolved,” Holder said. Officials at other agencies referred questions about a possible shutdown this year to the Office of Management and Budget in the White House. “Agencies are in the process of updating their plans” for a possible shutdown, Steve Posner, OMB communications director, said by e-mail. He said he had no further information. Hobbling IRS Most of the Internal Revenue Service would shut down if government funding expires, a prospect that has acting commissioner Danny Werfel “extremely concerned,” he told a House Ways and Means subcommittee Sept. 18. “We can’t process taxes, we can’t enforce, we can’t collect debts,” said Werfel, who was controller of OMB before taking the temporary IRS job earlier this year. “There’s so many things we can’t do that have a direct impact on our bottom-line deficits, so there’s irony there.” At the Pentagon, a government shutdown could trigger furloughs for about half of the Defense Department’s 800,000 civilian employees, according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based research institute that focuses on national security. Active-duty military personnel will report but their “pay may not go out,” Harrison said. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in a Sept. 23 memo to department employees said “a large number of our civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed” under a shutdown. Civilians Cut Already, most civilian defense employees were required to go without pay for six days this year because of automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. The loss of income from additional furloughs will trickle through local economies, Carter said, as workers will have less to spend. According to the Transportation Department’s 2011 plan, 40,141 of its 58,011 employees would keep working because their jobs are considered essential for safety or are funded through trust funds that don’t depend on the congressional appropriations process. At the Federal Aviation Administration, 33,550 of 48,463 personnel would stay on the job, including air-traffic controllers, airplane field inspectors and workers who maintain airport navigational aids, according to the 2011 plan. Traffic Safety The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees the auto industry, would retain 207 of its 591 workers, according to the 2011 plan. Safety research on occupant protection, drunk driving and motorcycle crashes, all financed by the Highway Trust Fund, would continue. A lengthy fight could leave companies that rely on the government for revenue in the lurch. Leigh Armistead, president of Peregrine Technical Solutions LLC, a small defense contractor specializing in cybersecurity, said that a slowdown in funding resulting from a shutdown could hurt his Yorktown, Virginia-based company, which employs about 20 people, including part-time workers and consultants. “I still have to pay salaries,” said Armistead, a retired Navy lieutenant commander. “If there’s a delay in payments, then all of a sudden I have to go to the bank and take out a loan to pay salaries.” Complaints from irate business owners helped push Democrats and Republicans to reach a deal during the last shutdown that lasted from December 1995 to January 1996, according to Hoagland of the Bipartisan Policy Center. Business Pressure “There was building pressure from the business community to resolve this,” Hoagland said. In those shutdowns, federal workers in roles relating to public safety, medicine, border patrol, emergency response, and air traffic control continued to work, according to a Congressional Research Service report released in August. The National Institutes of Health didn’t accept new patients into clinical research trials or answer hotline calls concerning diseases; applications to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were delayed; 368 National Park Service sites closed; and about 200,000 passport applications went unprocessed, according to the CRS. Of $18 billion in Washington-area contracts, $3.7 billion, or more than 20 percent, reportedly were affected adversely by the funding lapse during the 1996 government shutdown, CRS said. Lasting Effects Todd McCracken, president of the Washington-based National Small Business Association, said that a government shutdown could put small business contractors “behind the ball, even when the money starts flowing again.” “People can’t stick around without getting paid,” McCracken said in an interview. “There are bound to be some contractors that lose employees, especially if it goes on for more than a few days.” Some business leaders say they’re increasingly frustrated with the uncertainty over the budget, and are urging Congress to strike a deal that avoids a shutdown and reach a separate agreement to extend the debt ceiling, another looming deadline. “It feels like Groundhog Day all over again,” said Eric DeMarco, chief executive officer of San Diego-based Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. (KTOS) , which makes security and surveillance systems. “You couldn’t run a company like this. You can only run a government like this.” To contact the reporters on this story: Jim Snyder in Washington at jsnyder24@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Ivory in Washington at divory@bloomberg.net ; Kathleen Miller in Washington at kmiller01@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net ; Stephanie Stoughton at sstoughton@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "정부 셧다운 시, 어떤 연방 정부 업무가 '예외'로 간주되어 계속 운영될 수 있습니까?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "정부 셧다운이 장기화될 경우, 경제에 어떤 광범위한 영향을 미칠 수 있습니까?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "정부 셧다운이 금융 시장에 미칠 수 있는 잠재적인 영향과 투자자들이 고려해야 할 요인은 무엇입니까?"}]}
{"headline": "India’s One-Year Swaps at Six-Week Low After Reserve-Ratio Cut", "article": "India ’s one-year interest-rate swaps fell to the lowest level in six weeks after the central bank reduced the amount of deposits lenders must set aside as reserves to free up funds and spur economic growth. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cut the cash reserve ratio to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent, effective Sept. 22, adding about 170 billion rupees ($3.1 billion) to the banking system, the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday. Asia’s third-largest economy expanded 5.5 percent in the three months through June 30, near the 5.3 percent growth in the previous quarter that was the slowest since 2009. “This measure could be a more preferred route to signal a bias towards easing of the monetary policy stance without deviating from the anti-inflationary stance,” Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB) economists including Indranil Pan wrote in a research note today. “Additional CRR cuts to signal an easier monetary stance is not ruled out and will depend on the overall liquidity trajectory.” The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs fell two basis points to 7.71 percent in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since Aug. 7. Three of 39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast the reduction in lenders’ reserve requirements to the lowest level since 2004. The rest predicted there would be no change, after two earlier cuts in 2012. At yesterday’s policy review, the central bank left the repurchase rate unchanged for a third meeting to fight inflation. Consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in three months in August as costs of vegetables and sugar increased. The consumer- price index climbed 10.03 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 9.86 percent advance reported earlier for July, the Statistics Office said in New Delhi today. The rate at which banks borrow overnight from the monetary authority was last cut by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April. The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 dropped one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.17 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.

{"headline": "U.K. Plans Change to Tax Rule That Sent Nadal to Play in Germany", "article": "The U.K. government is proposing a change to a tax rule that caused Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal to warm up for the tennis tournament in Germany. Britain’s Lawn Tennis Association has been lobbying for a modification in the legislation covering foreign sports and entertainment figures, and welcomed proposals announced in today’s U.K. budget. The country’s tax authorities will now include training days during consideration of the proportion of global endorsements to tax, it said in an e-mailed statement today. Previously, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs based the tax on the number of U.K. tournaments players participate in as a proportion of total events per year. “This means that the U.K. should be more competitive in attracting the top tennis players to come and play here,” Roger Draper, chief executive officer of the LTA, said today in an e- mailed statement. “Having a world class player field is crucial to successful sports events, which inspires more people to play our sport, generates investment for British tennis, and provides a boost to the national and local economies.” Two-time Wimbledon champion Nadal last year said he wouldn’t prepare for Wimbledon at the grass courts of the Queen’s Club in west London , instead opting to play in Halle, Germany in the same week in June. The Spaniard told reporters in Shanghai that he would “lose money” if he played Queen’s, where he competed in five of the past six years. Former Wimbledon champion Andre Agassi in 2006 lost a 27,500-pound tax dispute at Britain’s highest court, which blocked other sports and entertainment figures from claiming millions from British tax authorities. He had challenged the taxation of sponsorship payments made by some of his endorsers.

{"headline": "Swire Pacific Said to Hire Banks for Property Unit Listing", "article": "Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) hired BOC International Holdings Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, and Morgan Stanley to help list its property unit in December, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The commercial landlord and owner of Hong Kong’s biggest airline said in a Sept. 22 statement that it may seek to list Swire Properties Ltd. without raising funds. The Hong Kong listing may allow Swire Properties to raise money later, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the information is private. Swire Pacific scrapped a planned initial public offering of the property unit last year because of “deteriorating market conditions,” the Sept. 22 statement said. The company had sought to raise as much as HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion), people familiar with the matter said at the time. Swire Properties has no “medium-term” need to raise funds after the July sale of its Festival Walk mall in Hong Kong , Chief Executive Officer Martin Cubbon said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Sept. 23. The sale gave the unit enough capital to meet expenses for current projects in China , he said. Swire sold Festival Walk to a unit of Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings Pte for HK$18.8 billion.

{"headline": "Obama Blames Gridlock on Republicans as He Courts Donors", "article": "President Barack Obama told a crowd of supporters at film mogul Harvey Weinstein’s home that Republican “hyper-partisanship” is to blame for holding up his second-term agenda. Speaking to a group of Democratic donors in New York City that included entertainer Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel, Obama pledged to find ways to work across the aisle, even as he faulted Republicans for creating gridlock in Washington. “My thinking was after we beat them in 2012 that might break the fever,” he told donors gathered yesterday evening at the West Village brownstone of Weinstein, head of the independent studio Weinstein Co. “It’s not quite broken yet, but I am persistent and I am staying at it.” The $16,200 per person event was the first of three Obama fundraisers yesterday for the Democratic Party campaign committee ahead of the 2014 congressional elections. The trip came hours after Obama addressed Republican criticism of his administration’s handling of the attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, and revelations that Internal Revenue Service workers targeted for special scrutiny tax-exempt groups promoting limited government. At a White House news conference with U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama called accusations that the White House sought to cover up a terrorist link to the Benghazi attack a “sideshow” that “defies logic.” IRS Case Regarding the IRS situation, in which the agency gave special attention to applications for tax-exempt organizations if they had “tea party” or “patriot” in their name, Obama said that those responsible would be held accountable. He called such action “outrageous,” if true. Obama told donors dining on petits fours in Weinstein’s living room that their contributions will help hold Republicans accountable for blocking his second-term agenda. Some Republicans, he said, are open to compromise, though they fear upsetting their party’s base and pundits such as syndicated radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. “If we’ve got folks on the other side who are prepared to cooperate, that is great and we are ready to go,” he said. “On the other hand, if there are folks who are more interested in winning elections than they are thinking of the next generation, then I want to make sure there are consequences to that.” Second Fundraiser After speaking at Weinstein’s home, Obama attended another $16,200 per person reception farther downtown at the residence of Alexandra Stanton, a prominent donor to Jewish causes and chief executive officer of Empire Global Ventures LLC, a New York-based international trade and business-development firm. At Stanton’s Tribeca apartment, Obama stressed his interest in the Middle East peace process, urging supporters to keep pushing for a solution even with the regional focus on the conflict in Syria. “Deep down there’s still this incredible desire for peace,” he said, calling his March trip to Israel a “highlight” of his second term. The third event benefited the Democratic Party and House candidates in 2014. Tickets to that reception, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan, started at $7,500. Obama has promised to headline at least 20 fundraisers for Democratic candidates across the country this cycle.

{"headline": "SAC Is Said to Reopen as Redemption Deadline Approaches", "article": "(Corrects name of network in last paragraph of story originally published Feb. 12.) Steven Cohen ’s SAC Capital Management LP is opening its main hedge fund to new investments after almost two years as a deadline for clients to redeem approaches, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The $14 billion SAC, whose clients have until Feb. 14 to ask to pull money from the fund, isn’t actively marketing it, said the person, who asked not to be named because the firm is private. The fund has been soft-closed to new investments since mid-2011, meaning it has selectively taken in money, mostly to accommodate current clients, according to the person. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told SAC in November that it is considering pursuing civil fraud claims related to alleged insider trading in two drugmakers by a former SAC portfolio manager. Prosecutors say Cohen, 56, discussed the stocks with the trader, the first time government officials have linked him to a transaction at the center of an insider-trading case. This week’s deadline applies to clients asking to pull money from the fund for the quarter ending March 31. SAC executives have told employees that it expects investors to request redemptions of about $1 billion, a person familiar with the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm said last month. SAC allows investors to take out 25 percent of their capital in a quarter, meaning the withdrawals from the fund would be about $250 million for March 31. Jonathan Gasthalter , a spokesman for SAC, declined to comment on the reopening, which was reported by Fox Business Network earlier today.

{"headline": "Jackson’s Lawyer Remembers Chimp, Buying Beatles Catalog", "article": "When John Branca got married on December 11, 1987, Bubbles the chimpanzee was a guest. “He was fully dressed in a tuxedo with a pocket square,” remembered Branca, Michael Jackson ’s lawyer and friend, and now the co-executor and co-manager of his estate. Three years after Jackson’s death, Branca, 61, was at the Venice Film Festival to promote “Bad 25” -- a vivid making-of documentary about the 1987 album, directed by Spike Lee. Branca is an executive producer. We met on the seafront terrace of the Excelsior Hotel on Venice’s Lido Island, after Lee presided over a small media roundtable, memorably attired in a “Bad” T-shirt, a black beret, and a large crucifix composed of tiny skulls. Lee would have preferred “Bad 25” to come out on the big screen instead of directly on TV. He fretted that, nowadays, youngsters watch movies on smartphones, even on first viewing, and pointed to his unamused teenage son, who listened quietly from behind a table of uneaten sandwiches. Branca -- in a black suit and pocket square -- looked back to his time with Jackson, whom he represented in the 1980s and 1990s, all the way up to 2006. He rejoined the team the week before his death. Financial Motive I asked whether there were financial as well as creative motives behind the 25th-anniversary tribute. “Yes: It’s been widely reported in the press that there was a substantial amount of debt,” Branca said. “So we felt we had to address that for the benefit of Michael’s children.” Privately, Branca remembered Jackson as “always very respectful of people,” “very fun-loving” and “a bit of a prankster.” At the Jackson residence, the chimp was a great source of entertainment: He copied whoever he saw -- including the domestic help. “Bubbles would have his cleaning rag out,” Branca said. “And Michael would joke with him: ‘Oh, Bubbles, there you are cleaning again!’” Jackson was otherwise very close to Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees -- he was the godfather of one of Gibb’s children -- and to Marlon Brando , whose son worked with Jackson and still works for the estate, according to Branca. Prince Competition By contrast, Jackson’s relationship with Prince was frosty, and there was a “healthy competition” between them. Still, one day, Jackson asked Branca to set up a meeting between them to discuss collaborating on the song “Bad.” “Michael’s vision was that he and Prince would sing this as a duet,” Branca said. “’Who’s bad?’ and they would sing back and forth.” The meeting (which Branca didn’t attend) went badly, and the duet never happened. “Apparently Prince brought Michael a gift, and it was some sort of voodoo box, and Michael was convinced Prince was trying to place a spell on him.” After the release of “Thriller” -- the best-selling album of all time -- Michael had “a significant amount of disposable income.” Never keen on buildings or tax shelters, he started buying music catalogs, including Sly and the Family Stone’s. When the Beatles library came on the market, Jackson asked Branca to contact Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. Ono “said she would be very pleased.” McCartney’s attorney said he wasn’t bidding. After a year, Jackson forked out $47.5 million for the purchase. The songbook is now part of a conglomerate that Branca describes as the biggest music publisher in the world, in which the Michael Jackson estate has a minority interest. Which of the children look likely to follow in his footsteps? “They’re a little too young, to predict that,” Branca said. Yet he can’t help share a foreboding. “Paris is very charismatic, and she’s expressed an interest in a film career.” “I could see her doing that,” he said of Jackson’s 14- year-old daughter, who may one day be promoting her own movie in Venice.

{"headline": "Deutsche Post, Bpost Told by EU Regulator to Repay Up to $1.3 Billion Aid", "article": "Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , Europe ’s largest mail carrier, and Belgium’s Bpost SA were ordered to repay government subsidies after European Union regulators said they broke antitrust rules. Deutsche Post must repay between 500 million euros ($648 million) and 1 billion euros in pension subsidies, the European Commission said today. Bpost must repay 417 million euros after Belgian state payments to the company exceeded the cost of delivering newspapers and magazines. The operator said today it will consider appealing the decision. Regulators last year expanded an investigation into payments from the German government to cover workers’ pension costs at Deutsche Post that may have hampered rivals that paid 10 percent to 15 percent more in contributions. The pension subsidies “conferred an economic advantage” on Deutsche Post, the European Commission said today. The firm “has effectively borne significantly lower social contributions than its private competitors for services which were open to competition,” such as parcel services and retail banking, the regulator said. A spokesman for Deutsche Post didn’t immediately return a call asking for comment. EU regulators approved government aid to Hellenic Post SA and France ’s La Poste. Tariff Income The EU probe broadened the scope of an investigation that started in 2007 into “all public measures, such as transfers of public money and tariff income” granted to Deutsche Post and its predecessor Postdienst since 1989. The prior probe was prompted by complaints from Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the world’s largest package-delivery company. In Belgium, the commission found that annual state compensation granted to Bpost for the delivery of newspapers and magazines “partly exceeded the net cost” of this service. The subsidies totaled 5.2 billion euros between 1992 and 2010, the EU said. Bpost will reimburse the aid before the end of June out of its cash reserves totaling more than 1 billion euros, the Brussels-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The investigation was triggered in part by Deutsche Post (DPW) and its DHL express-delivery unit winning a 2009 court ruling overturning state-aid approval of some subsidies to the Belgian post. Belgium in 2010 weighed an initial public offering for Bpost, which is owned by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and the Belgian government.

{"headline": "Ivory Coast Unrest Slows Cocoa Trade, Spurs Truck Inspections, ICCO Says", "article": "Ivory Coast unrest is slowing economic activity and cocoa trade “in particular,” International Cocoa Organization Executive Director Jean-Marc Anga said. Trucks carrying cocoa from villages to ports for exports are being subject to increased inspections by “the authorities and law and order officers,” Anga said by phone from London today. The Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa grower. The West African country is bracing for a second day of political violence after a disputed presidential election resulted in both incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara claiming victory. As many as 32 supporters of Ouattara, the United Nations-backed winner of the Nov. 28 election, were killed yesterday. The Ivory Coast cocoa crop for the season that started Oct. 1 will be 1.3 million metric tons, Macquarie Group Ltd. said on Dec. 6. That would be up from the year-earlier harvest of 1.2 million tons, Macquarie estimated in October. Cocoa prices in London have climbed 4.9 percent since the disputed election spurred speculation that violence would curb its bean exports. Cocoa for March delivery dropped 40 pounds, or 2 percent, to 1,966 pounds ($3,059) a ton by 12:37 p.m. on NYSE Liffe, the first drop this week. Crop Forecast “It is a bit early to change the crop forecast,” Anga said. “The cocoa trade is relatively resilient, even at the height of the civil unrest in 2002 cocoa was still able to leave the country.” Anga took over in October as executive director of the ICCO, representing 44 cocoa exporting and importing countries. The Ivory Coast has been divided since 2002, when rebels in the north attempted to topple Gbagbo. Its cocoa production has dropped from 1.4 million tons in 2005-06 as tree diseases curbed output. Anga, who was born in Ivory Coast, plans to return to the country next week based in Abidjan, the commercial capital.

{"headline": "Gafisa Considers Share Buyback as Losses End: Corporate Brazil", "article": "Homebuilder Gafisa SA (GFSA3) is considering buying back stock and increasing dividends after a restructuring that's intended to boost profit and reduce debt, Chief Executive Officer Alceu Duilio Calciolari said. Gafisa has been shifting its focus to building more lucrative projects as part of a turnaround plan that Calciolari said will be completed by the first half of 2014. Brazil ’s fifth-biggest homebuilder by revenue lost money in each of the past two years as it overestimated potential profit from a government-sponsored program for low-income families and built inexpensive homes faster than it could sell them. “We’re correcting our past mistakes,” Calciolari said in a Nov. 8 interview at Bloomberg’s office in Sao Paulo. “Everything we needed to do has been done. With better results, we may consider the possibility of buying back shares and paying additional dividends.” Surging economic growth and government subsidies aimed at getting lower-income Brazilians to buy houses encouraged Sao Paulo-based Gafisa and other homebuilders to expand with new projects throughout the country from 2008 to 2010. The builders have been retrenching as home sales slumped after the country’s economic expansion slowed to 0.9 percent in 2012 from a peak of 7.6 percent two years earlier, leaving a glut of unsold houses. ‘Decisive Year’ The BM&FBovespa Real Estate index, a gauge of 20 industry stocks , has lost 33 percent since the end of 2010, compared with a 25 percent decline for the country’s 72-member Ibovespa equity benchmark. “Most of them started to review operations and make adjustments in 2011, so 2014 will be a decisive year for the industry to show that its strategy worked,” Felipe Silveira, an analyst at the brokerage firm Coinvalores, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “Gafisa’s profitability is still suffering because of the old projects’ problems, and we should see low margins for some time.” Projects started by Gafisa’s low-income housing unit, Construtora Tenda, before the restructuring began in 2011 have margins of about 3 percent, and the last of them will be delivered in the next six months, Calciolari said. Margins at its other two units range from 35 percent to 50 percent, he said. ‘Unique Situation’ Proceeds from a 1.4 billion-real ($605 million) sale of its 70 percent stake in Alphaville Urbanismo SA, expected to close this year, will be used to reduce Gafisa’s debt-to-equity ratio to about 55 percent from 126 percent currently, according to the company’s third-quarter earnings report. Remaining cash may be distributed to shareholders, Calciolari said. Gafisa pays 25 percent of annual net income as dividends and made its last distribution in December 2011, the company’s press office wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. The Alphaville sale puts Gafisa in a “unique situation,” according to Guilherme Affonso Ferreira, who is chief executive officer of closely held investment firm Bahema Participacoes SA, Gafisa’s 17th-biggest shareholder according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The money will enable the company to effectively reduce its obligations to zero, leaving it with debt that's considered transitory and is passed on to home buyers when units are sold, he said. “Once the deal closes you won’t have any more corporate debt,” Ferreira said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “Among construction companies, few right now can cite this luxury.” October Sales Gafisa’s shares fell 1.7 percent to 2.85 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo, extending this year’s decline to 39 percent, as the real estate index slid 24 percent. While the company’s turnaround strategy appears to be working, Silveira said he’s still not sure if it will spur a rebound in the stock. “Earnings are improving, sure, but they still seem so weak given the company’s size and potential,” he said. The company posted adjusted net income of 15.8 million reais in the three months through September after three quarterly losses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg after Gafisa reported earnings on Nov. 5. That exceeded the average estimate among five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of a profit of 12.7 million reais. Gafisa’s contracted sales were 370 million reais in October, Calciolari said. That compares with the 429 million reais that the company reported for the entire third quarter. “This is a good indicator about the demand climate,” Calciolari said. ‘Growth Potential’ Stock investors don’t fully recognize the success of the company’s turnaround plan because they are excessively focused on the short term, Calciolari said. “Homebuilders have a long business cycle,” he said. Gafisa will remain focused on building in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro through 2015, Calciolari said. Projects marketed to lower-income consumers, which fell to zero last year and were resumed in 2013, may increase as Tenda’s operations improve and margins rise to a projected 28 percent, he said. “This percentage gives the company an interesting return,” Calciolari said. “Growth potential in this segment is high.” To contact the reporters on this story: Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at  dgodoy2@bloomberg.net ; Christiana Sciaudone in Sao Paulo at  csciaudone@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at  papadopoulos@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "가피사(Gafisa)의 구조조정 계획은 어떤 목표를 가지고 있었나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "가피사의 과거 실수와 현재 구조조정으로 인한 변화는 어떻게 연결되나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "가피사의 자본 배분 전략, 특히 자사주 매입과 배당금 증액 가능성은 기업 가치와 리스크 프로파일에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}]}

The basics Soil: Sue Hartman of Seattle Tilth , a nonprofit that focuses on building sustainable local food systems, recommends conducting a soil test as the first step. Agricultural programs across the country analyze soil samples and suggest treatments for deficiencies, with some universities charging as little as $10 for a routine soil analysis. Crops: Many superfoods flourish in the fall, and Hartman advises that if you are planting crops now, leafy greens will have the highest success rate. Some of the best cool-season crops include beets, arugula, radishes, Swiss chard, peas, chives, artichokes, broccoli, mustard greens, carrots, kale and lettuce. Seeds are available for purchase at local garden supply stores or online. When in doubt, order more than you think you’ll need. Timing: Depending on the region where you live, the ideal time to plant your fall vegetable garden will vary. The experts at BobVila.com recommend planting cool-season veggies in August and September and stress that it’s important to consider your area’s average first frost date. Ensure that you give your plants enough time to mature beforehand, and cover the garden if a frosty night is anticipated. “Mulching is great for conserving moisture and evening the soil temperature in the winter,” Hartman said, but she warns that wood chips should not be used for vegetable beds. Garden types Raised-bed gardens: For these gardens, you can choose to build your own bed or buy one. “The container is not a big deal, as long as you’re using untreated woods,” Hartman said. Make sure to choose a patch of land that gets ample sunlight. Also stock up on nutrient-rich compost and purchase a good fertilizer. Hartman recommends using a nitrogen-packed worm compost and liquid fertilizer. Nitrogen is quickly used up by plants and is crucial to vegetable growth. Deck, patio, porch or rooftop gardens: No backyard? No problem! As long as you have an area with access to at least six hours of sunlight, raised beds can be used on decks, patios, porches and rooftops. Make sure that the bed has a bottom with drainage holes. Standing beds are also a great option, especially for those with physical restrictions. One-pot gardens: This is the ultimate space- and time-saving gardening method. A galvanized water trough is recommended, but virtually any container with drainage holes will work. It is important, however, that each plant has enough room to grow, as plants battle for nutrients in cold weather. Also, consider the types of vegetables that grow well in containers. Hartman suggests staying away from rooted vegetables. Leafy veggies can be harvested quicker and thus are more successful. Lastly, ensure that plants are watered regularly, or install drip irrigation if you’re short on time. A garden can be very low-maintenance but still requires attention.

{"headline": "Navy SEALs’ Parents Sue Biden, Panetta Over Sons’ Deaths", "article": "Vice President Joe Biden and ex-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta were sued by the parents of Navy SEALs, who accused the officials of exposing their sons to retaliation by publicizing their unit’s role in the raid that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. The men were killed in an Aug. 6, 2011, attack on their helicopter, three months after the bin Laden raid, according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Washington. The parents, seeking more than $200 million in damages, accused Biden and Panetta of revealing the team’s involvement for political purposes before the 2012 presidential election. “The hard reality is that Biden and Panetta are alive ‘feasting’ on their ‘political notoriety,” power and wealth, while the brave heroes who gave their lives for our nation’s security are dead, thanks to them!” Larry Klayman, an attorney for the family, said in a statement on the filing. Thirty U.S. special forces, seven Afghan commandos and a civilian interpreter were among those killed when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down by the Taliban in the eastern province of Afghanistan. An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at the time that none of those killed were from the SEAL team involved in the bin Laden raid. The suit also names Iran , Afghanistan and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , who allegedly tipped the Taliban off about the helicopter coordinates on the day of the attack. SEALs’ Parents The plaintiffs are Billy and Karen Vaughn, the parents of Aaron Vaughn; Charles and Mary Ann Strange, the parents of Michael Strange; Doug and Shaune Hamburger, the parents of Patrick Hamburger; and Sidh Douangdara, the father of John Douangdara. A call to Biden’s press office seeking comment on the complaint wasn’t immediately returned. Panetta couldn’t immediately be reached for comment through his Panetta Institute for Public Policy.

{"headline": "Apple Wins Ruling, Sanctions in Samsung Infringement Suit", "article": "Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , sanctioned by a U.S. judge for failing to produce source code, said a ruling last week barring some evidence isn’t central to its defense against Apple Inc. in a patent-infringement lawsuit U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul S. Grewal wrote in his May 4 ruling that Samsung “plainly violated” a court order requiring it to turn over code to Apple, and ruled that Samsung won’t be able to offer evidence in the case about its efforts to “design around” three patents at issue in the case. In its lawsuit, Apple claims that Samsung’s 4G smartphone and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer infringe its patents. In December, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose , California , ruled against Apple’s request to block Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung from selling that phone and tablet in the U.S. That order followed an Australian court ruling lifting an injunction on the tablet there. Samsung, which was the world’s largest seller of smartphones last year, and Cupertino, California-based Apple have filed at least 30 lawsuits against each other on four continents since April 2011. In his ruling, Grewal said producing source code in patent litigation is “disruptive, expensive, and fraught with monumental opportunities to screw up.” Still, under federal law there is no exception to the requirement, especially when a defendant in a patent suit challenges the opposition’s failure to analyze the accused product’s source code, the judge said. Samsung Comments “The court’s decision is on just one of the many motions made by both companies in the process of the lawsuit,” Samsung said today in an e-mailed response to a Bloomberg inquiry. “It is not related to a final ruling on the patent-infringement case and Samsung Electronics will continue to actively seek to secure patent rights ,” Grewal said he focused on Samsung’s so-called design-around source code developed for products with the “specific intent” of avoiding Apple’s patent claims. The ruling targets that code because “by their very nature design-arounds impact key questions of liability, damages and injunctive relief,” Grewal wrote. “They are inevitably designed with substantial input from counsel for the specific purpose of distinguishing other products at issue,” Grewal wrote. “In short, they matter. A lot.” “It’s no coincidence that Samsung’s latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging,” Apple said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “This kind of blatant copying is wrong, and we need to protect Apple’s intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.” The case is Apple Inc. (AAPL) v. Samsung Electronics Co., 11-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).

{"headline": "Pine River Embracing Reverse Debt to Dodge Bernanke: Mortgages", "article": "Ben S. Bernanke is motivating bond investors to bet on the longevity of senior citizens. Bonds tied to reverse mortgages are drawing cash from investors including Pine River Capital Management LP’s real estate investment trust Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO) and Metacapital Management LP, one of this year’s top performing hedge funds. The government-backed loans, which let homeowners 62 and older borrow against their houses, are increasingly attractive as the Federal Reserve pushes down mortgage rates to record lows. Investors are targeting the $38 billion market for bonds tied to reverse mortgages as Fed Chairman Bernanke’s stimulus efforts help more homeowners refinance , which reduces the value of government-backed securities containing traditional home loans. Reverse mortgages -- pitched to seniors in TV ads by actor Robert Wagner and former Senator Fred Thompson -- are usually repaid only when a borrower dies or sells the property. “The cash flow is very reliable,” said Bill Roth, chief investment officer of Two Harbors, which has $1.9 billion of its about $18 billion in assets in so-called home equity conversion mortgages, or HECM, securities. That’s up from $658 million in mid-2011. “These types of bonds are not affected by the effort to keep the 30-year mortgage rate low.” ‘Blunt Changes’ The loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and packaged into bonds with a further guarantee from U.S.-owned Ginnie Mae. Senator Bob Corker told Shaun Donovan , secretary of the Department of Housing, at a Congressional hearing yesterday that “you are losing your shirt” on reverse mortgages with brokers making an “absolute fortune.” Corker, a Tennessee Republican, suggested shutting the program down for two years. Donovan said the FHA, which faces a projected $16.3 billion shortfall in its insurance fund, may make “blunt changes” on an interim basis including new limits on the terms of the loans to protect its finances. While borrowers don’t make monthly payments, they are considered in default if they aren’t current on their property taxes and insurance. As long as the borrower stays in the home and the equity isn’t exhausted, the securities accumulate interest on the loan. “For retired homeowners that have paid down their mortgage, a reverse mortgage can be a way to obtain a low cost line of credit with no fear of eviction,” said Merrill Ross, an analyst with Baltimore-based Wunderlich Securities Inc. “It allows the homeowners to age in place while paying medical or other bills.” Fewer Homeowners Fewer homeowners took out the debt this year as the largest lenders exited the market. There were about 49,080 new loans this year through November, according to data provider Reverse Mortgage Insight Inc., down from 64,058 in the same period last year and a peak of 115,176 in 2008. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Bank of America Corp. stopped giving the loans in the aftermath of the housing crisis and criticism from advocate groups including the National Consumer Law Center, which alleged that some unscrupulous lenders use the product to take advantage of elderly homeowners. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo was accused in a class action lawsuit filed last year of foreclosing on homes with reverse mortgages after the owners died without giving heirs a chance to purchase the property at 95 percent of appraised value, as FHA rules require. ‘Very Complicated’ “It was a profitable line of business for us, but it simply was a narrow market, a very complicated product,” Michael Heid, president of the bank’s home-loan unit said in a May conference call to investors. Only 2 or 3 percent of the 24 million households in the U.S. that are eligible have taken out a reverse mortgage against their properties, according to Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC) , which last month bought originator and servicer Reverse Mortgage Solutions. “While the reverse mortgage market is significant today, we anticipate it will grow tremendously in the coming years as it rebuilds from the economic downdraft, loss of key participants, and most importantly as a result of both demographic and economic factors,” Walter Investment chairman and chief executive officer Mark O’Brien said on a September call with investors. The U.S. census bureau estimates that by the year 2030 the number of eligible households will grow to more than 40 million, said O’Brien. “The industry is obviously poised for explosive growth,” he said. Specialty Firms Specialty firms such as Atlanta-based Generation Mortgage Co., Urban Financial Group, and One Reverse Mortgage, a division of Quicken Loans Inc., are filling in the lending gaps and raising the visibility of reverse mortgages. Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) agreed in October to buy Genworth Financial Home Equity Access Inc., the company that started a new campaign with actor Wagner, who starred in “It Takes a Thief” and played Number Two in the “Austin Powers” trilogy. About $7.3 billion in reverse mortgage bonds have been issued this year through November after almost $10 billion in 2011, according to Bloomberg data compiled by Knight Capital Group Inc. Ginnie Mae said it had $38 billion of the securities outstanding at the end of October. Underwriters introduced securities tied to floating lending rates that helped to increase issuance, according to Darren Stumberger, head of agency MBS trading at Knight Capital in New York. Relative Spreads Spreads on fixed-rate reverse mortgage bonds have narrowed to about 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, over swaps from 140 basis points at the start of the year, according to Knight. That compares to negative 16 basis points for 3.5 percent Ginnie Mae bonds backed by traditional 30-year fixed loans, according to Bloomberg models. “They have explicit government guarantees, little prepayment risk, limited policy risk and wider spreads” than other Ginnie Mae securities, said Deepak Narula, the head of New York-based Metacapital, which oversees $1.6 billion. Purchasers of HECM bonds receive unscheduled payments of principal and interest when a loan in the pool is repaid. If a borrower defaults, the individual loan is removed from the pool and the FHA pays off the bonds. The FHA also takes out loans if the principal balance reaches 98 percent of the maximum claim amount. That means that even if “the fountain of youth” is discovered, said Roth, mortgage investors won’t suffer significant extension risk. Bond Buying In addition to the Fed’s bond buying program, President Barack Obama ’s re-election has fueled investors’ concerns that the government will seek to accelerate refinancing, increasing interest in housing debt that’s less likely to be repaid early. “They call these borrowers ’one and done,’” said Jeff Traister, a reverse mortgage trader for New York-based Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “It’s a very, very small amount that prepay.” Mortgage bond investors monitor prepayment rates since they influence returns. Bondholders risk losses when buying debt for more than 100 cents on the dollar as the value can be erased when homeowners take out new mortgages too quickly to repay existing debt. With debt trading below face value, returns increase when repayments accelerate. Two Harbors, the publicly traded Minnetonka , Minnesota-based REIT, has also acquired prepayment-protected Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities that will help it avoid having to reinvest in debt at lower rates. The firm also formed Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. to focus on single-family homes and this month filed to raise as much as $265 million in an initial public offering. Even as investors such as Two Harbors see value in reverse mortgages, the collection of mortgage bonds is smaller and less liquid than the broader $5.2 trillion government-backed market. That means it can be more costly to buy and sell the securities. “The market is young so there are lower volumes and spreads are generally a bit wider than comparable asset classes,” Stumberger said. “Once originations increase, the market will become more meaningful with more supply creating new demand and improving liquidity.” To contact the reporter on this story: Heather Perlberg in New York at perlberg@bloomberg.net Christine Harvey in New York at charvey32@bloomberg.net Jody Shenn in New York at jshenn@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "역모기지란 무엇이며, 어떻게 작동하나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "역모기지가 전통적인 주택담보대출과 비교하여 투자자에게 어떤 장점을 제공하나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "역모기지 시장이 성장함에 따라, 투자자, 주택 소유자, 그리고 정부 기관에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}]}

(GOOG)  The stock fell 15 percent in London, the steepest decline since July 2008, to 181 pence, valuing the Chester, England-based company at 981 million pounds ($1.49 billion). Trading volume was more than 12 times the three-month daily average. Moneysupermarket said revenue in July is “flat” compared with a “strong” corresponding month last year, when a new advertising campaign was started. The company plans this year’s campaign for next month, it said in a statement. First-half sales rose 10 percent from a year earlier to 112.3 million pounds. Slowing insurance revenue growth, following changes by Google to search algorithms, was compounded by the lack of specific comment on full-year prospects in the earnings statement, Steve Liechti, an analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. who recommends clients buy the stock, said in a note. “First-half figures are fine and marginally above our forecast, but the financial year outlook comment looks an issue,” he said. “We intend to tweak numbers down given second-half uncertainties.” Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 29 percent to 39.9 million pounds. The company also said today that Paul Doughty will step down as chief financial officer no later than June 1, 2014. Google Risk Investors should also factor in the risk on the stock of Google vying for market share, which could unravel Moneysupermarket’s price-to-earnings ratio from 18 to less than 12, David McCann, an analyst at Numis Securities, said in a note to clients.

{"headline": "Wind-Driven Snow Blankets East Coast, Snarls Air, Ground Travel", "article": "New York City’s major airports resumed operations after the heaviest December snowfall in six decades left travelers in the Northeast struggling amid waist- high drifts and blizzard winds. The city’s Central Park had 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow by 8 a.m., the most for the month since 1948 , the National Weather Service said. Skies cleared over New York by daybreak as the agency issued blizzard warnings for Boston and into Maine. The storm forced airlines to cancel more than 6,000 flights since yesterday, when airports began to close. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International and Newark Liberty airports opened tonight for outgoing traffic. “There may have been storms that equaled this, but it doesn’t get much worse than this,” Tom Kines , a meteorologist at State College, Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather Inc., said by telephone. “To get this much snow with the amount of wind that is accompanying it, that is devastating.” New York, which faces a $2.5 billion deficit in the $65 billion budget projected for next year, will be more affected by lost economic activity than clean-up costs, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a City Hall news conference. Getting Around The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market kept normal hours today. The New York Mercantile Exchange delayed the opening of floor trading until 11 a.m. “They pay me good money to be here,” said Vinny Stavola , an Oppenheimer & Co. convertible trader, who trekked from Staten Island to get to work in midtown Manhattan by 6:30 a.m. “It doesn’t take a heroic effort to get to work, just a little dedication.” The storm, with winds gusting to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour), reached New York at midday yesterday. The day after Christmas is one of the five busiest shopping days of the year, and it may take retailers two weeks to recover from lost sales, said Marshal Cohen , chief industry analyst at NPD Group Inc., a research firm based in Port Washington, New York. Economic Impact The snowfall was the fifth-largest on record for the city, Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty said at the mayor’s news conference. “In the grand scheme of things, given the size of our budget and the size of our deficit, this is very small,” Bloomberg said. “It’s the lack of commerce that takes place. Yesterday and today were big shopping days, and that didn’t happen, so your sales tax revenues will be lower, and those are the things that really hurt.” The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. Amtrak resumed operations between New York and Boston today after canceling services late yesterday. Metro-North commuter trains resumed limited runs at midday after being halted by wind-blown snow, while the Long Island Rail Road was closed, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority website. Commuter Trains NJ Transit, which carries about 170,000 commuters to and from New York City daily, suspended bus service as of 8:30 p.m. yesterday until tomorrow, according to a statement. Service between Newark and New York was shut by signal problems and other trains will run on modified schedules, the agency said. Four hundred subway passengers were aboard an A train that was stuck in Queens for more than six hours, until it could be pushed to a station by another train. The Coney Island area was without subway service. As much as 29 inches of snow was reported in Bergen County, New Jersey, while Union County had as much as 26, the Weather Service said. Winds gusted to almost 70 mph in some areas. Interstate 280 westbound, one of the main approaches to downtown Newark, was almost deserted at 8 a.m. and acting Governor Stephen Sweeney ordered state offices closed. Home Depot Inc., the world’s largest home improvement retailer, is shipping additional snow shovels, snow blowers and ice melt to stores from North Carolina to Maine, said Ron DeFeo , a company spokesman. NYC Deploys New York City will have 365 salt spreaders and 1,700 snowplows on the streets, and sanitation department employees will work 12-hour shifts, Bloomberg said yesterday. Boston and its suburbs may receive as much as 18 inches from the storm, said Alan Dunham, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Taunton, Massachusetts. Part of central Massachusetts may receive as much as 22 inches. U.S. carriers canceled at least 3,389 flights today, after cutting more than 3,334 yesterday, as they waited for airports to open in the Northeast, spokesmen said. Airlines in some cases grounded flights ahead of the storm to keep planes from getting stuck at closed facilities. Delta Air Lines Inc. cut 1,000 flights systemwide, said Trebor Banstetter, an airline spokesman. “As the weather clears, we are aiming to resume normal operations late Monday and into Tuesday across the East Coast,” Banstetter said in an e-mail. Continental Airlines and its regional partner carriers have canceled 800 flights for today, while United grounded 175, said Mike Trevino , a spokesman for United Continental Holdings Inc. The carrier expects to resume flights out of New York-area airports and Boston in the afternoon, he said. More Cancellations Southwest Airlines Co. cut 188 flights today, primarily in Norfolk and Boston, said Brad Hawkins , a spokesman for the Dallas-based carrier. It expects to resume flights in some northeastern U.S. airports about mid-day, he said. US Airways Group Inc. canceled 550 flights today, mostly into and out of New York, Philadelphia and Boston, said Jim Olson , a spokesman. Flights into Boston are set to resume after 11 a.m. today, he said. American Airlines and its commuter carrier, American Eagle, canceled 446 flights today, said Ed Martelle, a spokesman. The two airlines cut 427 flights yesterday and American cut 40 scheduled for tomorrow. JetBlue Airways Corp. scrubbed more than 300 flights today after cutting 270 yesterday, Mateo Lleras , a spokesman for the New York-based carrier, said in an e-mail. Unsafe for Crews “Today we’re also dealing with closed runways, roads that are barely passable and trains and buses that are not running,” JetBlue told customers today in a company blog. “In many cases, conditions are not safe for our crewmembers or our customers to get to the airports, where it’s even possible.” The storm also brought snow as far south as parts of Jacksonville, Florida, AccuWeather said on its website. The storm system began in the South over the Christmas holiday. Four inches of snow fell in Chattanooga, Tennessee, while 8 inches was reported in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Environment Canada issued a blizzard warning yesterday for northeastern New Brunswick and warned of heavy snow or rain in the rest of the Maritime provinces today. Sixteen inches of snow may fall in New Brunswick, and rain may accompany the snow in Nova Scotia. Winds may gust to 87 mph (140 kph) in eastern Nova Scotia and 80 mph in western Newfoundland, the agency said.

{"headline": "Company Credit Swaps Fall as IBM, Google Reports Beat Estimates", "article": "A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk fell as 75 percent of companies that have reported profits for the last quarter exceed analyst estimates. The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1 basis point from Jan. 18 to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points as of 5:07 p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Bond markets were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Confidence that the economy is gaining strength is building, as 63 of the 84 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that have reported fourth-quarter earnings beat forecasts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Among information technology companies, 15 of 18 reported positive surprises. The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. Google Inc., owner of the world’s largest search engine, said today that fourth-quarter profit excluding certain items rose to $10.65 a share. Analysts had projected per-share earnings of $10.50. International Business Machines Corp., the world’s biggest computer-services provider, forecast earnings in 2013 will be at least $16.70 a share. That compares with the $16.64 average estimate of analysts tracked by Bloomberg. High Yield The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High Yield Index declined 2.7 basis points to 436.3 basis points, Bloomberg prices show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , the third-largest publicly traded U.S. hospital chain, sold $850 million of bonds to fund repurchases of outstanding debt. The 4.5 percent notes due April 2021, rated B1 by Moody’s, yield 307 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will fund purchases of Tenet’s $714 million of 10 percent, first-lien debt due May 2018, the Dallas-based company said in a statement. The average relative yield on junk-rated debt was little changed at 4.74 percentage points, Bloomberg data show.

{"headline": "Rupee Jumps Most Since May 2010 on Central Bank’s Move to Curb Speculation", "article": "India ’s rupee surged the most in 19 months, extending its rebound from an all-time low reached yesterday, after the central bank announced measures to curb speculation in the foreign-exchange market. The currency, this year’s worst performer in the region, strengthened the most among Asian currencies after the Reserve Bank of India said companies can’t enter into multiple forward contracts to cover a single overseas transaction. It pared gains as the monetary authority, which has raised interest rates 13 times since the start of 2010 to cool inflation, kept them unchanged at a policy review in Mumbai today. “The RBI has taken decisive measures to reduce onshore speculation against the rupee,” said Olivier Desbarres, head of foreign-exchange strategy for the region at Barclays Capital in Singapore. “These measures have certainly caught the market’s attention and it reduces the chances of a rapid weakening of the rupee.” The rupee jumped 1.7 percent to 52.7450 per dollar in Mumbai, the biggest gain since May 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose as much as 2.7 percent earlier. The currency, which fell to an all-time low of 54.3050 yesterday, has lost 1.3 percent this week and 15.2 percent in 2011. The new rule applies to domestic as well as foreign investors and takes effect immediately, according to a central bank statement published after the market closed yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. The RBI also said it will reduce the amount of open positions dealers can maintain overnight. ‘Buy Time’ The Reserve Bank ’s move will be positive for the rupee in the “short-term,” increasing transaction costs and showing the RBI is looking to curb currency-market speculation, according to Standard Chartered Bank Plc. “This, along with some intervention from the RBI, will buy time for the country to address medium-term issues such as the current-account deficit and capital outflows,” said Ananth Narayan G., head of South Asia currency and bonds trading at Standard Chartered in Mumbai. Those are the “root causes of the rupee’s weakness.” Overseas funds cut holdings of Indian shares by $353 million this year after adding $29 billion in 2010, exchange data show. The nation’s current-account shortfall, which was $14.2 billion in the three months ended June 30, may widen to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March, Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar said this month. ‘Line in the Sand’ “The step is likely to stem the fall in the rupee but is unlikely to put on an appreciating bias,” Indranil Pan , chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, wrote in a report published today. “The aim is to reduce speculative positions and demand for dollars.” The Reserve Bank may not boost the rupee beyond 52 because “it understands fundamentals are working against currency appreciation” in India now, Barclays Capital’s Desbarres said. The curbs on forwards trading are in addition to steps taken by the central bank last month to boost the supply of dollars in the local market. The Reserve Bank eased rules in November for companies to borrow abroad and sell foreign currencies through swaps and raised the interest rate on bank deposits for Indians living overseas. A further decline in the rupee threatens to stoke inflation that has stayed above 9 percent for 12 months. Every 1 percent depreciation in the currency boosts the rate of gains in wholesale prices by 6 to 10 basis points, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The central bank’s latest measures show “the commitment of the RBI to fight further rupee depreciation,” said Sebastien Barbe , chief emerging-market strategist in Paris at Credit Agricole CIB. “I think this draws a line in the sand at close to 54 per dollar.” To contact the reporters on this story: Jeanette Rodrigues in Mumbai at  jrodrigues26@bloomberg.net ; V Ramakrishnan in Mumbai at  rvenkatarama@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sandy Hendry at  shendry@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "인도 루피화의 가치 하락을 막기 위해 인도 중앙은행이 취한 조치는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "인도 중앙은행의 외환시장 개입이 단기적으로 루피화 가치에 어떤 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상되는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "인도 루피화의 가치 하락이 인도의 거시경제 환경에 미치는 영향과 그로 인해 인도 중앙은행이 직면한 정책적 딜레마는 무엇인가?"}]}
{"headline": "Pound Strengthens Versus Euro on ECB Loans, BOE’s Weale Comments on Easing", "article": "The pound posted its biggest weekly gain versus the euro this year as the European Central Bank loaned a record amount of cash to the region’s banks, increasing the supply of the 17-nation currency. Sterling was also boosted as Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Martin Weale said inflation was likely to persist in the U.K., reducing the need for further asset purchases. The ECB loaned 529.5 billion euros ($699 billion) to the region’s banks on Feb. 29 in the second of its longer-term refinancing operations. “The pound is looking firmer against the euro and there seems little doubt that the LTRO has had a mildly negative impact against the single currency,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London. “Weale’s comments moved additional U.K. quantitative easing further away at the same time as Europe is effectively doing more.” The pound strengthened 1.7 percent this week to 83.27 pence per euro as of 5:03 p.m. in London yesterday, the biggest advance since the period ended Dec. 16. The currency jumped 1.1 percent on Feb. 29, the day the LTRO was announced. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.5849. This week’s refinancing operation meant the ECB has now offered more than 1 trillion euros in three-year loans to the region’s banks to contain the sovereign debt crisis. ‘More Persistence’ Higher oil prices and potential wage pressures “suggest a risk that there may be more persistence to inflation than one might expect at a time of rising unemployment,” Weale said in a speech in London on Feb. 29. “I do not think there is likely to be a further case once our current program is complete” in early May for more bond purchases. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt increased seven basis points over the week to 2.14 percent. The 4 percent bond due March 2022, which became the benchmark on Feb. 29, closed the week at a price of 116.695. Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds, Europe’s benchmark securities, have dropped 0.1 percent. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep its bond-buying target at 325 billion pounds when it next meets on March 8, according to all the 45 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The U.K. will sell as much as 1 billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds maturing in 2034 on March 6. It will auction up to 4 billion pounds of 1 percent bonds maturing in September 2017 the following day.

{"headline": "Hoyer Says Obama Could Strike Syria Without Congress Vote", "article": "The second-ranking House Democrat said President Barack Obama has the authority to use military force against Syria without returning to the U.S. Congress for approval should diplomacy fail to compel the Syrian government to surrender its chemical weapons arsenal. Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said neither he nor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat, “believe the president is required to come to Congress in this instance, and could act on his own.” Hoyer, in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with Al Hunt ” that airs this weekend, also said House Republican disarray on strategy in battling Obama over the federal budget and raising the nation’s borrowing limit makes a government shutdown at month’s end more likely. On Syria, Hoyer said only a brief window exists for Russia to prove that its bid to require Syria to give up its chemical arms stockpile to avert a U.S. military strike is “real” -- “certainly not longer than weeks.” If the effort fails, Hoyer added, Obama’s hand would be strengthened in taking military action if Congress explicitly empowered him to do so. “If we passed a resolution, he’d have a stronger hand,” Hoyer said. “But having said that, neither the Russians nor the Syrians ought to conclude that the president is without authority to act.” ‘Extra Mile’ The attempt at a diplomatic solution may also help Obama influence lawmakers to support a military strike, Hoyer said. “People would say, ‘Well, he went the extra mile, he reached out, he took the diplomatic course that people had been urging him to take -- and it didn’t work,’” Hoyer said. “And therefore under those circumstances, the only option available to us to preclude the further use of chemical weapons and to try to deter and degrade Syria ’s ability to use them is to act.’” The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution authorizing military force against Syria, and the Senate was prepared to vote on the measurer this week. The resolution appeared to face growing House opposition. Then, when the prospect of a negotiated settlement arose, Obama said in a national televised address on Sept. 10 that he was asking Congress to delay voting. Health-Care ‘Gambit’ On fiscal issues, Hoyer said Democrats will never agree to the Republican bid to delay funding for the 2010 health-care law in exchange for funding the government, calling it a “gambit” the opposing party could use to continuously keep the measure from being carried out. “We’re not going to be bludgeoned and blackmailed into adopting something with respect to the health-care bill that the voters rejected” in giving Obama a second term last November, he said. Calling the Republicans “fixated” on repealing the law, Hoyer said, “As long as ‘shut down the government’ is their bludgeon, is their threat, is their hostage, that’s not a negotiable issue.” While he and some influential Republicans oppose the automatic across-the-board spending cuts imposed earlier this year, Hoyer conceded they are likely to remain in effect for the foreseeable future. “The sequester is an irrational, common-sense-defying fiscal policy” that should be replaced with a “big deal” that both cuts federal spending and while also raising revenues , Hoyer said. “I don’t think it’s going to happen,” he said.

{"headline": "Dolphins Delay Meeting With Martin on Bullying at NFL’s Request", "article": "The Miami Dolphins and owner Stephen Ross postponed a meeting with Jonathan Martin at the request of the National Football League, which is investigating the lineman’s allegations of being harassed by teammates. Ross had said he planned to meet today with Martin, who left the team on Oct. 28, to “see how he’s doing and listen to his concerns.” Dolphins President Tom Garfinkel said yesterday that the NFL and Ted Wells, a New York attorney overseeing an independent probe into the harassment allegations, asked that the team’s meeting with Martin be delayed until investigators meet with him first. “Out of deference to the process, we will cooperate with their request,” Garfinkel said in a statement. “We look forward to meeting with Jonathan directly as soon as possible.” The Dolphins indefinitely suspended offensive lineman Richie Incognito on Nov. 4 for conduct detrimental to the team after an expletive-filled voice message he sent to Martin became public. The Dolphins also asked the NFL to investigate. Martin endured harassment “far beyond the traditional locker room hazing” for the entire 1 1/2 seasons he spent with the Dolphins and was physically assaulted by a teammate, his lawyer, David Cornwell of Gordon and Rees LLP in Atlanta, said on Nov. 6. The NFL the same day said Wells, who was involved in investigations of the National Basketball Players Association and the Syracuse University men’s basketball team, would oversee the probe of the Dolphins.

{"headline": "Michigan Pays 40% More as Detroit Debt Hits Spread: Muni Credit", "article": "The yield penalty on Michigan’s debt has climbed 40 percent in less than two weeks as defaults by Detroit and two school districts lead investors to question the state’s commitment to protect bondholders. Buyers demand about 0.49 percentage point of extra yield to own general obligations of Michigan instead of benchmark securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s up from 0.35 percentage point on June 13, the day before Detroit emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr released his plan to avert a record municipal bankruptcy. The proposal included halting payments on $2 billion of munis. The month before, school districts in Buena Vista and Pontiac defaulted. They were the first such issuers in the state to do so, according to research firm Municipal Market Advisors. The events call into question Michigan’s willingness to preserve the safety of securities backed by a municipality’s full faith and credit, said Shawn O’Leary, a senior research analyst in Chicago at Nuveen Asset Management, which oversees $95 billion of local-government debt. “There’s a tremendous amount of selling -- people are very anxious about Michigan cities,” said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Concord, Massachusetts-based MMA. “Those districts defaulting are absolutely a sign of the state’s eroding concern about bondholders.” Turnaround Task In Michigan, where no locality has filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, about 10 percent of its 9.9 million residents live in communities under fiscal oversight, said O’Leary. Orr, a former bankruptcy lawyer, is trying to turn around a city that has lost a quarter of its population since 2000. He proposed a deal June 14 that included skipping a $39.7 million payment on pension-obligation debt as the city grapples with $17 billion in liabilities. Uninsured Detroit debt maturing in April 2016 traded this week at 33 cents on the dollar, down from 90 cents earlier in June. “Michigan historically has been a state that will work to support the credit quality of its underlying municipalities,” O’Leary said. “If the state has any interest at all in preserving the market access of those communities, it needs to say that it supports the legality and strength of the general-obligation pledge.” ‘No Involvement’ Karen Cain, treasurer of Pontiac School District, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, wasn’t available to comment, said Valdria Rowe, executive administrative assistant. A message left with Brittanny Anderson, secretary to the superintendent of the Buena Vista district, wasn’t returned. The community is about 100 miles northwest of Detroit. Terry Stanton , a spokesman for Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon, said the state had “no involvement in either issue.” The deals weren’t part of a state program that provides credit enhancement to debt approved by Dillon for capital projects. The Republican-controlled legislature last week passed two bills allowing the state to dissolve Buena Vista and the Inkster district near Detroit. The bills await Republican Governor Rick Snyder ’s signature. About 55 Michigan school districts project budget deficits this year, said Matt Butler, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. The New York-based company doesn’t grade Buena Vista’s district, and has Pontiac’s at Caa1, seven steps below investment grade. Michigan has an Aa2 rank, third highest. Deficit Districts Jurisdictions facing budget shortfalls must submit a deficit-elimination plan to the state, said Martin Ackley, a spokesman for Mike Flanagan, state superintendent. If a system fails to, the state withholds funding, he said. Pontiac and Buena Vista schools both missed May 1 debt-service payments because Michigan halted aid in the prior two months, Butler said. The state’s not intervening to protect bondholders was a surprise, he said. “Our understanding has been with these tools that the state has, it would not allow a district to default,” Butler said in a telephone interview. “It does raise new questions going forward for any other districts that fall into a position like this.” Detroit Focus Tax-exempt Pontiac school bonds maturing in May 2015 traded this week at an average yield of 9.14 percent, or about 93 cents on the dollar. That’s about 7.5 percentage points more than benchmark munis. The debt is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. “Syncora Capital Assurance Inc. received and duly paid a claim in full” related to the Pontiac district, Michael Corbally, a spokesman for Syncora, said in an e-mail. The Pontiac system has $14 million of debt, while the Buena Vista district has about $2.5 million, Bloomberg data show. Buena Vista’s district enrolls 435 students, compared with about 5,200 in Pontiac’s. The state may not have intervened because the debt was insured and authorities were focused on Detroit, said Tom Metzold, co-director of munis at Eaton Vance Management in Boston. “I’ve got to believe that Detroit has taken up 100 percent of the state’s time,” said Metzold, who helps oversee about $30 billion in munis. “These are the very same insurers that are in Detroit. In effect, it’s being taken care of regardless as part of the whole Detroit situation.” Insurers’ Backing Insurers back about 80 percent of Detroit general-obligation and pension bonds, according to Lisa Washburn, a managing director at MMA. Syncora said in a June 17 statement that it would pay claims on the certificates of participation on which the city failed to make payments. School districts in Michigan are also allowed to have emergency managers appointed by the state. An emergency has been in place for Detroit Public Schools since March 2009, according to the treasurer’s website. Highland Park School District and Muskegon Heights School District also have state-appointed overseers, according to the website. Pontiac’s system is under review for an emergency manager. Investors will watch for signs that Snyder approves of Orr’s plan for bondholders, Nuveen’s O’Leary said. A sign of endorsement from the governor could further punish localities statewide by weakening the perception of their full faith and credit backing, he said. “If the governor signs off on the plan as currently proposed, the state is tacitly supporting the view that the G.O. pledge isn’t worth its credit,” O’Leary said. “In that case, you suddenly call into question the creditworthiness of every G.O. offered in the state of Michigan.” Market Movement In the $3.7 trillion municipal market, Illinois is set to sell $1.3 billion of general obligations today, the week’s biggest offer, as investors are poised for their worst monthly losses since 2008. Institutional investors are joining individuals in exiting the market as yields surged to the highest since 2011. Bondholders such as mutual funds were offering about $2 billion of munis for sale as of June 24, the most since Bloomberg data began in 1996. Ten-year AAA munis yield 2.96 percent , the highest since April 2011. The interest rate compares with 2.61 percent for similar-maturity Treasuries. The ratio of the yields, a gauge of relative value, is about 113 percent, the highest since August. The greater the figure, the cheaper munis are compared with federal securities.

(SPN) , which is trying to buy a provider of hydraulic-fracturing services in North America, fell the most in more than two months as more of its contracting peers report additional costs associated with moving from natural gas to oil basins in the U.S. and Canada. Superior, based in New Orleans, dropped 6.1 percent to close at $25.78 in New York, the biggest decline since Nov. 9. Carbo Ceramics Inc. (CRR) , the largest provider of manufactured materials for the technique used to extract oil and gas from shale, said in an earnings statement today that fourth-quarter costs increased because of its shift to oil basins. Gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and EQT Corp. have announced they’re curtailing production because of low prices. “Superior seems to be taking its lumps,” Trey Stolz, an analyst at Iberia Capital Partners in New Orleans , who rates the shares “outperform” and owns none, said in an interview. “The momentum is snowballing on this North American logistics issue with the Carbo earnings release today.” Halliburton Co.

Third District banks reported little overall change in loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book, although business loan and residential mortgage volumes edged up, while consumer loan volume eased. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders indicated that activity, which was already at a seasonal low along a low part of the business cycle, was dampened further by poor weather. Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said that leasing and construction activity have remained at low levels since the last Beige Book. Service- sector firms reported that activity has increased modestly. Business contacts reported still more instances of price increases for inputs than they did in the previous Beige Book , and output price increases emerged in February as reported by contacts in several sectors. The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but not strong. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to increase moderately on a year-over-year basis. Bankers expect only slight growth in lending over the next two quarters. Contacts in residential real estate expect little or no increase in activity for the year as a whole. Contacts in commercial real estate expect market conditions to improve slowly during the year. Service-sector companies expect continued slow growth through the first half of 2011. Manufacturing Third District manufacturers reported strong increases in shipments and new orders from January to February. Producers across a broad spectrum of 11 manufacturing sectors reported increased demand. Declines in orders were predominant only among producers of apparel and of testing and measuring instruments. Producers within the furniture, petroleum, and fabricated metals sectors reported no overall change in demand. Some manufacturers credited global markets and energy markets as drivers of new demand, and one specifically cited China ’s rising costs as allowing them to reclaim work previously lost overseas. Several manufacturers mentioned ―tough winter conditions‖ as affecting shipments and lowering demand. Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in February, about half expect increases in new orders and shipments, and less than one-tenth expect decreases. Executives from several sectors that supply the construction industry cited very low levels of highway construction in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic region and expressed concern over future federal and state highway funding. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers remain positive, but lessened somewhat over the past two months, mostly from January to February. Retail Third District retailers generally reported modest year-over- year increases in sales in January and February. Snowstorms deterred shopping and limited the advance in sales in January, retailers said, but most of those contacted for this report indicated that sales rebounded in February. However, revenue increases have been adversely affected by clearance sales of winter merchandise. The consensus among merchants in the region is that sales will continue to grow as the spring selling season gets underway. Most of the merchants who gave forecasts expect sales to increase moderately. The general opinion was expressed by one store executive who said, ―We are cautiously optimistic, although we do not think the consumer will step up buying strongly until employment picks up.‖ Third District auto dealers contacted in February reported that sales were above the year-ago level and rising gradually from the January level. Dealers generally considered their inventories to be in line with near-term sales expectations. Dealers anticipate sales this year to exceed sales last year, although some remained concerned that further increases in gasoline prices could limit the improvement in sales. Finance At most of the Third District banks contacted for this report, total outstanding loan volume has been roughly level since the previous Beige Book. Overall, business loan and residential mortgage volumes outstanding have edged up at commercial banks in the District, but consumer loan volume outstanding has eased. The outlook among Third District bankers interviewed in February is that total loan volume will expand only slightly over the next two quarters. Bankers said that consumers will remain reluctant to borrow until employment begins to improve more steadily and that business firms are still focused on strengthening balance sheets rather than taking on more debt. One banker expressed a view shared by many when he said, ―Creditworthy businesses are not looking to borrow.‖ Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity remains ―in the doldrums,‖ according to builders and brokers throughout most parts of the Third District. A builder described traffic as ―anemic‖ through January, as the typical winter lull was depressed further still by harsh weather across the District. While some builders noted a pickup in traffic in early February, the ―slower-than-normal January means we won’t know for awhile‖ whether overall trends are improving. While home prices continue to fall in most parts of the District, the softness is primarily in higher-end homes. The greater than usual prevalence of distressed property sales creates some additional competition for new homebuilders. While market participants ―want to be positive,‖ most seem to have grown weary and wary of anticipating any near-term improvement in the housing sector. They are positioned for a year of little or no growth. There has been little change in commercial and industrial markets in the Third District since the previous Beige Book, according to area nonresidential real estate firms. Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents have been nearly steady for most property types, although vacancy rates for apartment buildings have been moving down. Contacts in some parts of the District also reported some slight gains in occupancy of industrial buildings. Construction activity has been roughly steady at a slow pace. Looking ahead, commercial real estate contacts expect market conditions to improve slowly during the rest of the year, with increases in construction and occupied space held back by restrained financing and slow employment growth in the region. One contact said, ―It will probably take some office markets several years to recover the loss of occupancy caused by the recession.‖ Services Service-sector firms generally reported modest increases in activity since the previous Beige Book. Business-service firms generally have been posting slight gains as their customers see gradual improvement in their own activity. However, as one business-service firm noted, ―Customers are keeping within their budgets, and we have to be responsive to that.‖ Moderate improvement was also noted by firms in the telecommunications, professional services, and health care sectors. Most of the services sector firms contacted for this report expect slow growth in the months ahead. Prices and Wages Reports from manufacturers since the previous Beige Book indicated still more pervasive increases in input costs. While much less prevalent, output price increases are becoming more widespread throughout the manufacturing sectors. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been steady or declining as they clear out winter merchandise. However, a growing number of retailers mentioned that wholesale costs are rising for goods they are purchasing for sale during the second half of the year. Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last Beige Book, although some said they have raised wages and salaries for certain skilled occupations. Employment agencies said there has been some growth in demand for workers recently, and some colleges in the region reported that more companies plan to recruit on campus this year than last year.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "금리 인상 시, 제조업의 자본 지출 계획에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "부동산 시장의 회복이 지연되는 상황에서, 상업용 부동산의 공실률과 임대료에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "서비스업의 성장세가 둔화되는 상황에서, 비즈니스 서비스 기업들이 어떻게 고객사의 예산 제약에 대응할 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "N.Y. Thruway Pays Least as Tappan Zee Loan Prepared: Muni Credit", "article": "Investors are driving the New York State Thruway Authority’s borrowing costs to a 14-month low relative to benchmark debt in a bet that the agency will be able to finance the largest project in its 63-year history. The operator of the longest U.S. toll road, which is building a $3.9 billion replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River , plans to borrow $875 million this month, according to Standard & Poor’s. It needs the funds as it awaits approval of a federal loan that’s already taken a year to process and is holding up the spending plan for the structure. Building the span is a priority for Governor Andrew Cuomo , who compares it in scope to the 19th-century construction of the Erie Canal. It would double the agency’s $3.7 billion debt load. Yet the extra yield on some of the longest-maturing Thruway bonds is close to the smallest since they were issued in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The Thruway Authority has good market access ,” said Howard Cure, head of municipal research at New York-based Evercore Wealth Management LLC, which oversees about $4.7 billion, including Thruway debt. “People aren’t that concerned about such an essential-purpose project.” Biggest Loan The Tappan Zee is one of the nation’s largest public-works projects and the federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan of more than $1 billion that Cuomo requested would be the biggest awarded by the U.S. Transportation Department. The 55-year-old Democrat is banking on the low-cost funds to keep cash tolls from almost tripling on the replacement to the 57-year-old bridge. Cuomo has said the majority of the financing will be through toll-backed bonds. The authority is waiting to find out the size of the loan before determining how much it’ll need to borrow through the $3.7 trillion municipal market. The 3-mile-long Tappan Zee, which connects Rockland and Westchester counties about 20 miles north of New York , was designed to last 50 years. It carries 138,000 vehicles each day, 40 percent more than intended. Private Deal The $875 million of notes that the authority’s board of directors plans to sell in a private placement will repay $500 million in debt due Sept. 30 and also finance construction, Joe Pezzimenti, an S&P analyst, wrote in an Aug. 30 report. The authority had planned to use the federal loan to pay off the $500 million bought by Barclays Plc in February. “The project is currently undergoing a creditworthiness analysis at the U.S. DOT,” Nancy Singer, a Federal Highway Administration spokeswoman in Washington, said by e-mail. “We are aware of the situation and are working with the state of New York.” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a U.S. Senate hearing in July that the project is “of national significance” and he expects it to move forward. If it does, New York will be asked to submit a formal application and then negotiate terms, a process that can take longer than three months, according to the agency’s website. The authority “remains committed to ensuring our long-term financial health and maintaining our current credit rating ,” Dan Weiller, an authority spokesman, said by e-mail. “We are in almost constant contact with USDOT,” he said. Matt Wing, a Cuomo spokesman, said by phone that he referred to the Thruway Authority for comment. Relative Return As the authority grapples with how it’ll pay for the bridge, Thruway bonds maturing in January 2042 traded Sept. 3 at an average yield of 4.96 percent, Bloomberg data show. The debt has an A+ grade from S&P, fifth highest. It yielded about 0.38 percentage point more than benchmark munis, close to the smallest spread since the bonds’ June 2012 issue. Agency debt hasn’t been exempt from the biggest losses in the municipal market since 1999. The average price on the bonds due in 2042 fell below 100 cents on the dollar on Aug. 19 for the first time since they were issued, Bloomberg data show. The securities have since rallied to as high as about 102 cents on the dollar, the data show. “The credit sells extremely well in-state,” said Clark Wagner, who oversees $1.5 billion as director of fixed income at First Investors Management Co. For individual investors looking to buy bonds, as prices fall below par, “the credit aspect isn’t as important as the dollar price.” October Wrap The authority expects to have the loan and complete its financing plan in October, according to Pezzimenti. The agency’s credit rating may fall depending on spending on the bridge and capital costs needed to maintain its 570-mile (917-kilometer) toll road, Pezzimenti said. The delayed loan shows municipalities “can’t always assume there will be a timely response from Washington ,” Cure said. “It gets more problematic the more it gets pushed out.” By 2016, the agency will be near the bottom limit of the debt-coverage ratio required by bond covenants, according to projections in budget documents that didn’t include the cost of a new bridge. Last year, it scrapped a plan to raise tolls on trucks by 45 percent, replacing the more than $80 million the increase would have earned with state funds pushed through the legislature by Cuomo. Ratings Concern “They will have to take further action before the bridge is done,” Pezzimenti said by phone. The rating company is concerned the authority won’t be able to maintain its rating “without implementing some revenue enhancements or lower costs,” he said. The authority may benefit from dwindling muni debt throughout New York. The state and its localities issued about $19 billion this year through last week, compared with about $30 billion over the same period in 2012, Bloomberg data show. Last year, New York issuers sold more securities than any other state. The drop in sales has helped buoy New York munis, which have lost 4.8 percent this year, compared with a 5.3 percent decline for the broad market, S&P data show. Municipal issuers from Virginia to California are set to sell $4.8 billion in long-term debt next week. Localities plan to issue about $1.5 billion this week, which was shortened by the Labor Day holiday. At 3.11 percent , yields on benchmark 10-year munis are the highest since April 2011. The interest rate compares with 2.89 percent (USGG10YR) for similar-maturity Treasuries. The ratio of the yields, a gauge of relative value, is about 108 percent, compared with an average of 93 percent since 2001. The higher the figure, the cheaper munis are compared with federal securities.

{"headline": "Reagan-Gorbachev Winery Improves Taste Without Raising Prices", "article": "When John Jordan was handed the reins of his family’s Sonoma County, California, winery in 2005, he had little experience in the industry and several big decisions to make. Jordan Vineyard & Winery , established by his father, Tom, in 1972 as an American version of Bordeaux’s famous chateaux, had built a reputation for producing balanced cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev shared a Jordan chardonnay bottle during a 1987 state dinner, and sales were brisk. So some company employees were surprised when Jordan beefed up the sales staff and directed them to cut back deliveries for some long-time customers so bottles could be given to new ones. “My dad said, ‘What’s the matter with you?’” Jordan recalled. “You’re spending all this money growing the sales force and infrastructure when you’re already selling everything.” Jordan, a former Navy officer and partner at a mortgage- fraud firm, said he made the moves to prepare for the crash of the housing bubble. “I knew demand would fall off, so if you could grow the number of accounts, you could afford a 30 percent hit in store sales,” he said. “And that’s what we did.” The worst economic decline since the Great Depression damped sales of wine bottles costing more than $20 as consumers cut back on luxury spending. The retail value of California wine sales fell 5.3 percent from 2007 to 2009, the first dip in at least a decade, according to the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. Better Taste In addition to increasing the sales force, Jordan pushed for a better tasting wine. Though he dismissed suggestions to sell a more expensive line of cabernet sauvignon, he asked winemaker Rob Davis to make a batch of wine that would be worthy of a reserve label. Jordan was so impressed with the results that he told Davis, “I sure wish it could all taste like this.” Davis, who has been with the winery since the beginning and apprenticed with legendary winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff, said he could do that for a price. Davis wanted to spend more on storage barrels, age the wine longer before selling it and have the option to buy fruit from nearby growers. Jordan’s father had preferred to use most grapes from his own 250-acre estate. Jordan approved the changes, but kept the price at $52 per bottle. (The company also sells a chardonnay for $29.) Ivy-Covered Mansion The changes were evident during a tasting at Jordan’s estate in Healdsburg, about 70 miles north of San Francisco. The 58,000-square-foot, ivy-covered brick mansion serves as a tasting room, culinary center and winemaking facility. While the winery’s 1999 and 2002 bottles were dense on the palate and showed predominately dark chocolate and earthy tones, the 2006 and 2007 vintages were lighter and highlighted plum and black-fruit flavors, without losing depth and power. The changes have helped the wine reach a broader audience, said Robert Nicholson, principal at International Wine Associates , a liquor consulting and financing firm in Healdsburg. “The family very much knows what they’re doing,” Nicholson said.

{"headline": "PBOC Says China Shouldn’t Be ’Blindly Optimistic’ on Inflation", "article": "China can’t be “blindly optimistic” about its inflation outlook at a time when uncertainties remain in areas such as property and farm produce prices, the country’s central bank said. China will continue to pursue a prudent monetary policy to keep prices stable, the People’s Bank of China said in its first-quarter monetary policy implementation report. The bank will also further push forward interest-rate liberalization and reform of mechanisms for forming the yuan’s exchange rate, according to the report. The central bank’s comments came after China’s statistics bureau reported today that the consumer price index rose 2.4 percent in April, compared with a median forecast of 2.3 percent in a Bloomberg News survey. Moves to loosen government control over utilities and resources may also lead to higher inflation later in the year, the central bank said in the report. Food prices rose 4 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with 2.7 percent the previous month, with fresh-vegetable prices helping drive the pickup in broader inflation from March’s 2.1 percent pace, according to the statistics bureau. Surging capital inflows into the country also complicated the central bank’s task in guarding against any flare-up in inflation, according to the report. China’s monetary-market rate snapped a three-day drop as the central bank sold bills today for the first time since 2011, draining cash from the financial system as accelerating yuan gains spur capital inflows.

{"headline": "Sprint Primed for Takeovers After Stock Jumps", "article": "Sprint Nextel Corp.’s (S) stock has more than doubled this year and its cash is near a six-year high, paving the way for an acquisition that could strengthen its efforts to challenge AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless. Sprint’s stock surged 136 percent for the second-biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as the wireless provider boosted sales with Apple Inc.’s iPhone and began rolling out a faster network. Cash (S) and equivalents stand at almost $6.8 billion after reaching the highest this year since the end of 2005, the year it bought Nextel Communications Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the carrier’s debt exceeds its $16.6 billion market value, the stock gain bolsters its currency for a deal, Gabelli & Co. said. The $36 billion Nextel takeover, intended to create a stronger No. 3 player, instead left Sprint with incompatible networks, fleeing subscribers and five years of losses. With Sprint now showing signs of improvement, Gabelli said the company could expand its customer base by acquiring a smaller rival such as MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) or Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) A combination with T-Mobile USA, the fourth- biggest provider, would create a carrier with the size to challenge AT&T (T) and Verizon Wireless, Macquarie Group Ltd. said. “When you’re doing a better job and the stock’s reflecting it, there’s a greater willingness to do something and willing sellers on the other side of the transaction,” Zack Shafran, an Overland Park , Kansas-based money manager at Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., which oversees more than $90 billion including Sprint shares, said in a telephone interview. “You have two very large players in the form of AT&T and Verizon and now it’s argued that a strong No. 3 would be a welcomed player. Sprint seems on the verge of perhaps being that strong third player.” Sprint Role Sprint Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse said in a Sept. 6 interview at the company’s Overland Park headquarters that consolidation “would be constructive” for the industry. “Sprint will play a role in that some way,” Hesse said. Scott Sloat , a Sprint spokesman, declined to comment yesterday on whether the company is currently considering a deal. Sprint is in the second phase of a three-part turnaround under Hesse, who was hired in December 2007 to fix the damage caused by the failed Nextel deal. The past four years were a recovery period during which the company cut staff by a third, moved to wind down the Nextel network and turned its focus to developing a faster network using long-term evolution, or LTE, technology. Spending Stage This year is the first of a two-year spending stage, with the company projecting a return to profitability in 2014. Sprint has a commitment to buy $15.5 billion worth of iPhones and is investing $7 billion to dismantle the Nextel network while building a new one using LTE under a program called Network Vision. Sprint shares had their biggest gain in almost three years on July 26, surging 20 percent after the company reported revenue that exceeded analysts’ estimates on higher iPhone sales. The stock closed at $5.70 on Sept. 24, the highest since June 2011. Today, Sprint shares fell 1.3 percent to $5.46. The company’s cash and equivalents, which dwindled to as low as $2.1 billion in the wake of the Nextel purchase, climbed to a six-year high of $7.6 billion in the first quarter and stood at $6.8 billion as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While more stable now than a year ago, Sprint is still “under-scaled,” said Hesse. On LTE technology, Sprint is at least a year behind Verizon Wireless , the joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vodafone Group Plc. With 32.6 million monthly subscribers as of June 30, it didn’t even have half of No. 2 carrier AT&T’s 69.7 million subscribers , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Verizon Wireless had 88.8 million. Deal Currency With Sprint’s stock soaring, the company has more latitude to increase its customer base by pursuing a takeover, said Sergey Dluzhevskiy, a Rye, New York-based analyst for Gabelli, a unit of Gamco Investors Inc., which oversees about $36 billion and owns Sprint shares. “Sprint’s stock price is key as far as potentially proceeding with a deal,” Dluzhevskiy said in a phone interview. The rally in Sprint shares “obviously helped in terms of currency.” Sprint abandoned plans earlier this year to buy Richardson, Texas-based MetroPCS after the board rejected the transaction, which may have cost as much as $8 billion including debt, two people familiar with the plan said in February. At the time, Sprint’s stock was trading at less than half its value yesterday. ‘Meaningful’ Expansion A revived deal for MetroPCS or a takeover of Leap Wireless (LEAP) would be “meaningful” for Sprint as it strives to expand its presence in the wireless market, according to Gabelli’s Dluzhevskiy. MetroPCS, a $4.2 billion company, would add 9.3 million prepaid subscribers to Sprint’s base, while Leap, a San Diego-based provider with a market value of $531 million, would add 5.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MetroPCS CEO Roger Linquist said during a presentation last week at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference in New York that the company’s position as a relatively small and growing carrier made it the “belle of the ball” in an industry heading for consolidation. Drew Crowell, a MetroPCS spokesman, declined to comment on whether the company had been approached or would consider an offer from Sprint. Gregory Lund, a Leap spokesman, declined to comment on a potential deal with Sprint. Adding Scale Kevin Smithen, a New York-based analyst with Macquarie, said a deal for T-Mobile USA would go further in helping Sprint gain the critical mass needed to take on AT&T and Verizon. T- Mobile, a unit of Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , had 24.1 million contract customers as of June 30, according to its most recent earnings release. “In a perfect world, Sprint would prefer to do a merger with T-Mobile to add scale and spectrum,” which are radio waves for expanded network coverage, Smithen said in a phone interview. “It would give them price leverage, and it could help change the competitive dynamics of the industry.” Jenny Gore, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, Washington-based T- Mobile, declined to comment. While a combination with T-Mobile would make Sprint a stronger competitor, it could draw the same regulatory scrutiny that derailed AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of the carrier last year, said Gabelli’s Dluzhevskiy. He also said T-Mobile’s use of different operating networks means any deal would probably be “a messy integration project.” Heavy Leverage Sprint’s high debt levels -- $21 billion as of June 30 -- could also be a barrier to any deal, according to Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Concord, New Hampshire-based Granite Investment Advisors Inc., which oversees about $560 million, including Sprint shares. The carrier’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was 4.2 as of June 30, compared with leverage of 2.1 times at AT&T (T) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “They clearly can’t add debt onto their balance sheet,” Schermerhorn said in a phone interview. “They’re pretty levered as it is so I’m not sure how you put the whole thing together.” Sprint also may hold off on pursuing an acquisition until it completes work on its network upgrade, said Keith Trauner, a Miami-based money manager at GoodHaven Capital Management LLC, which oversees more than $300 million, including Sprint shares. ‘Transition Period’ “They’re still in this transition period where they’re spending a lot of money to improve and consolidate their network,” Trauner said in a phone interview. “Our hope is that they would finish the network upgrade, fix the balance sheet and make acquisitions, in that order.” Sprint’s Hesse said that while the company is focused on its Network Vision rollout plan, that wouldn’t necessarily preclude the carrier from contemplating a deal. “The preference, from an execution point of view, would be to not undertake more complexity in the Network Vision program until the middle of next year,” Hesse said. “That doesn’t rule out M&A now.” To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net ; Brooke Sutherland in New York at bsutherland7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at srabil@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "Sprint Nextel Corp.의 주식이 올해 두 배 이상 상승한 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "Sprint Nextel Corp.의 현금 보유량이 6년 만에 최고치에 도달한 것이 인수합병에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "Sprint Nextel Corp.이 T-Mobile USA를 인수할 경우, AT&T Inc.와 Verizon Wireless에 대항할 수 있는 경쟁력을 갖추게 될까요?"}]}

Farhat Rajhi also announced the detention of his predecessor, Rafik Belhaj Kacem, who led the crackdown in December and January against protesters seeking to end Ben Ali’s 23-year rule. Kacem will spend a renewable period of three days under arrest for interrogation, Rajhi told Hannibal TV channel. Forty-two senior security officials were replaced, including the heads of general security and presidential security, he said. “There is a conspiracy against state security,” said Rajhi, who alleged that some of the security forces were behind recent looting incidents, including those in which gangs entered schools in the capital of Tunis. Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on Jan. 14, ending a 23-year rule, after the army refused to put down demonstrations that overwhelmed his internal security forces. The transitional government took over, vowing within six months to hold the North African nation’s first free elections since independence from France in 1956. “Violence and chaos is right now the biggest risk to a transition to democracy,” Mohsen Marzouki, a Tunisian who heads the Qatar-based Arab Democracy Foundation , said by telephone. “The old regime is sending a signal that it still holds key positions and that the purge against its members should not go far, as it can make life difficult for any new leadership.” Attacks were carried out on schools, public buildings and shops in Kasserine, Sfax, Beni Khlad and Medenine, with police failing to intervene, the Assabah newspaper reported today. ‘Stakes Are High’ “The stakes are high for the transitional government,” Maouia Kaabi, a financial consultant in Tunis, said in telephone interview. “Security is needed if we are to fill our 200,000 hotel beds with tourists.” Tourism accounts for 7 percent of the $40 billion economy and employs 400,000 people. Unemployment exceeds 13 percent of the workforce and two of every three jobless Tunisians are below 30, according to the International Monetary Fund. The movement against Ben Ali started in mid-December as a protest against poverty. Mohamed Bouazizi , a street vendor in the central town of Sidi Bouzid, set himself on fire when a municipality official confiscated his wares and humiliated him, sparking the unrest, according to local media. The United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 219.

{"headline": "Obama Sets News Conference as Congress Debates Debt Limit", "article": "President Barack Obama scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference in Washington as Senate Democrats said they plan to introduce a bill to raise the debt ceiling, which would need Republican votes to advance. Obama will take questions in the White House briefing room on a day when he called House Speaker John Boehner to “reiterate that he won’t negotiate on a government-funding bill or debt-limit increase,” said Brendan Buck , a Boehner spokesman. The White House, in a statement, urged Boehner to allow a vote on raising the debt limit and repeated that only Congress can authorize more borrowing. Obama is willing to negotiate after Republicans end the shutdown and remove the risk of default, the statement said. The sniping came as lawmakers are taking the first tentative steps toward resolving the standoff. Both sides are exploring actions that will be needed to end the week-old shutdown and raise the debt limit before U.S. borrowing authority lapses Oct. 17. Senate Democrats will introduce a bill today that would raise the debt ceiling for a year, said Senator Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat. They are planning a test vote before the end of this week. Six Republicans To succeed, they’ll need support from at least six Republicans on procedural votes. They’ve gotten backing from one Republican, while several others haven’t ruled out the possibility. Risk appetites in U.S. capital markets diminished amid the U.S. budget impasse, pushing Treasury one-month bill rates to the highest since 2008 and Internet stocks to the biggest losses in two years. Rates on one-month bills reached 0.34 percent, the highest since October 2008, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.8 percent to 1,662.77 at 1:36 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq Internet Index tumbled 3.8 percent, the most since November 2011. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.3 percent, paring an earlier rally of 0.6 percent, with China’s benchmark index rising more than 1 percent as trading resumed after a holiday. The yen slid 0.2 percent against the dollar. Test Vote The Senate Democrats’ plan emerged as Gene Sperling , the director of Obama’s National Economic Council, opened another route toward at least a temporary resolution. He declined to rule out a short debt-limit extension while reiterating the administration’s preference for a longer-term agreement. House Republicans , who had previously discussed pairing a debt-limit increase with a list of party priorities, haven’t released legislation or set a time line for action. Instead, they’re planning to vote to appoint a working group of House members and senators to settle the multiple impasses. “The American people are watching an unwillingness by one side to negotiate and compromise,” Representative Tom McClintock, a California Republican, told reporters in Washington today. “They are watching utterly vindictive actions by the administration to intensify the pain of the shutdown and I think they watching the collapse of the administration’s signature program, Obamacare.” House Democrats rejected the idea, saying it would recreate the 2011 bipartisan supercommittee that was deadlocked. “We don’t need a supercommittee,” said Representative Xavier Becerra , a California Democrat. “The votes exist right now” to reopen the government. Republican Senators Still to be determined is whether House Republicans will consider a vote to raise the debt-ceiling this week or wait for the Senate to act, said two Republican congressional aides, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss party strategy. If all Senate Democrats along with six Republicans vote for giving Obama authority, they could send a debt-limit increase without policy conditions to the Republican-controlled House early next week. That would put pressure on Boehner, who opposes a clean debt-limit bill. “We’ve got a situation where you have a calendar running, you have people who are frustrated and upset, and so let’s figure it out,” Senator Lisa Murkowski , an Alaska Republican, said in an interview at the Capitol yesterday. “We shouldn’t be dismissing anything.” Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, wouldn’t take a position on a clean debt-ceiling increase when asked by reporters yesterday. Senator Joe Manchin , a West Virginia Democrat, didn’t commit his support either. Kirk Supports Republican Mark Kirk of Illinois will support a clean debt-limit increase. About a half-dozen others -- including Murkowski, John McCain of Arizona, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine -- kept open the option of voting for a debt-ceiling increase without conditions or helping one pass. None of the proposals being floated has been embraced by both parties and all face long odds. The chance of a U.S. government default is “reasonably high,” Bruce Ratner, chairman of developer Forest City Ratner Cos., said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. There’s a “small group of people who don’t have an understanding of how serious it is,” he said, adding that “the ramifications are huge.” Bruce Josten , the chief lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that the spending bill and the debt-limit increase are “must-pass” bills. “The debt ceiling specifically must pass on a timely basis to avoid inflicting substantial and enduring damage on the U.S. economy ,” he said. Head Start The partial shutdown, which began Oct. 1, has shuttered government services such as Head Start preschool programs and national parks and furloughed federal employees. Other functions, such as mail delivery and Social Security benefits, are continuing. Obama reiterated yesterday that he won’t negotiate with Republicans over the shutdown and the debt-limit increase, which have merged into a single fight that has proven intractable so far. Republicans are insisting on changing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while Obama refuses to engage in discussions about tying policy conditions to opening the government or raising the debt limit. Borrowing Authority The U.S. will run out of borrowing authority on Oct. 17 and will have about $30 billion in cash after that. The country would be unable to pay all of its bills, including benefits, salaries and interest, sometime between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The House has been passing separate funding bills for parts of the government, including the National Institutes of Health and national parks. Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have rejected those measures.

{"headline": "Southern California Home Prices Climb to Four-Year High", "article": "Southern California home prices rose to a four-year high last month, helped by an increase in transactions involving more-expensive properties and a decline in foreclosure sales, DataQuick reported today. The median paid for houses and condominiums was $309,000 in Los Angeles , Riverside, San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange counties, the highest since August 2008, when the median was $330,000, the San Diego-based data provider said in a statement. Prices were up 1 percent from July and almost 11 percent from a year earlier. Home demand is rising because of “super-low” mortgage rates and a recovering economy, DataQuick said. A declining supply of homes on the market, “a substantial increase in mid- to high-end transactions,” and a drop in the sale of foreclosures, which tend to sell at a discount, also helped buoy the median price, the firm said. The number of Southern California homes that sold last month for $200,000 to $400,000 rose 11 percent, and those priced between $300,000 and $800,000 jumped 23 percent, DataQuick said. Sales of homes priced at more than $800,000 climbed 19 percent from a year earlier. “August was the strongest month for home sales so far this year, and the strongest for an August in six years,” DataQuick President John Walsh said in the statement. “Much of the pick- up in activity reflects a continuation of trends we’ve seen for months, like the unleashing of pent-up demand in move-up markets and high levels of cash and investor buying.” A total of 22,438 houses and condominiums sold in Southern California last month, up 9 percent from July and 14 percent from a year earlier, DataQuick said. The tally was the highest for the month of August in six years.

{"headline": "Karl Rove Wears Gingham Dress, Reagan Hugs Lamblike Glenn Beck", "article": "It’s hard to walk past the window of Manhattan gallery Mulherin Pollard Projects without stopping to admire Karl Rove , dressed as Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz.” In a painting titled “Perfect Happiness,” the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush wears a blue gingham dress and ruby slippers as he (she?) stands in a lush nighttime garden with one arm around the neck of a Bambi-like fawn. The cheeky artwork by Canadian artist Michael Caines is part of an exhibition that also depicts Glenn Beck , Richard Nixon and Kim Jong-Il (but no Canadians) as oddly garbed creatures with oversized heads. “I’ve been trying to understand American politics and history,” said Caines, 46, in a telephone interview from his studio in Brooklyn, New York. “The works are about my right to assert my imaginative power.” The show’s seven paintings and five drawings are skillful executions that sometimes elicit a tender spirit with their peculiar meld of 19th-century political cartoon and characters from Fragonard, Goya and the John Tenniel illustrations of “Alice in Wonderland.” They aren’t eliciting much legal tender, however. A week into the show, only one drawing had sold: An ink-on-paper rendering of the gingham Rove. “We couldn’t count on his previous collectors,” said dealer Katharine Mulherin, who has worked with Caines since 1999. “I thought maybe we should target political comedians.” One painting, “Little Lamb of the GOP,” depicts young Ronald Reagan as Jesus cradling a little lamb with Glenn Beck’s face. The two figures are set against the backdrop of purple mountains and green sky. Household Art It’s a reworking of Del Parson’s “Lost Lamb” painting, “that is probably found in most fundamentalist households in America,” said Caines. So there’s another market niche alienated. The North Korean leader wears a ball gown straight out of Velazquez’s “Las Meninas” in the drawing titled “Lil’ Kim.” “Tea Party” portrays the late conservative U.S. Senator Jesse Helms with floppy ears and talk radio host “Dr. Laura” Schlessinger as the Mad Hatter. “I don’t know how many people would want to have Glenn Beck’s face or Ronald Reagan’s face in their home,” said Caines, who leans politically to the left. “I would.” Prices range from $1,200 to $1,400 for drawings and from $5,000 to $10,000 for paintings. “Perfect Happiness” runs through Dec. 31 at 317 Tenth Ave.; +1-212-967-0045; http://mulherinpollard.com.

{"headline": "Abe Spurs Tripling of Overseas Debt Buying on Yen: Japan Credit", "article": "Shinzo Abe, the front-runner to become Japan ’s next prime minister, is helping drive an almost tripling of foreign bond buying by local investors as he calls for central bank steps to fuel inflation and weaken the yen. Net purchases of overseas debt climbed 285 percent to 15.2 trillion yen ($185 billion) this year through Nov. 17, Ministry of Finance data show. Japan’s currency dropped 5.1 percent this quarter, boosting import costs and eroding demand for local securities. While Japan’s 20-year bond yield has climbed 1 1/2 basis points to 1.66 percent since the end of September, it’s lower than the 2.3 percent on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party ’s Abe has called on the Bank of Japan to pump unlimited cash into the market to kindle inflation, sapping demand for longer-dated bonds before elections next month. The extra yield investors demand to hold Japan’s 20-year debt instead of 10-year bonds rose to a 13-year high on Nov. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Investors are going abroad for higher yields because of declining interest incomes” caused by the BOJ’s monetary easing, said Shuntaro Take, the deputy general manager for the corporate accounting and investment department at Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance Co., which manages about $47 billion in Tokyo. “Stronger expectations for effective policies from the Abe administration would put the yen in a weakening trend, increasing foreign-bond investments even more.” BOJ’s Responsibility Abe, who was the prime minister for a year through September 2007, said yesterday that the Bank of Japan isn’t taking responsibility for the real economy. He called for adding a mandate to spur inflation as part of any changes to the law governing the central bank. The BOJ aims for annual inflation of 1 percent. The government “ strongly ” expects the central bank to continue powerful monetary easing to overcome deflation, while the bank hopes for measures from the government to strengthen Japan’s growth potential, Economy Minister Seiji Maehara , Finance Minister Koriki Jojima and BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in a statement on Oct. 30. A Nikkei newspaper poll on Nov. 16-18 showed that 37 percent of the respondents supported Abe becoming the next prime minister, compared with 25 percent for Yoshihiko Noda, the current premier. The nation will hold elections on Dec. 16 for the lower house of parliament. “An Abe-led administration may create a bigger flow to foreign bonds because of possible capital gains from exchange rates on top of yield differentials,” said Shinji Kunibe, chief portfolio manager for fixed-income investment in Tokyo at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees the equivalent of $62 billion. “Investors had been unable to foresee any sustainable yen weakness until recently.” Fujifilm Bonds Elsewhere in Japan’s credit markets, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. raised 130 billion yen yesterday in its first sale of non- convertible bonds, the nation’s biggest debt offering by a non- financial company since March. The Tokyo-based copier and camera maker issued three tranches, including 60 billion yen of 0.33 percent five-year notes, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Toho Gas Co., which supplies gas to the Nagoya metropolitan area in central Japan, offered 10 billion yen of 0.792 percent 10-year debt, according to a statement yesterday from Daiwa Securities Group Inc. Japan’s corporate bonds have handed investors a 0.14 percent loss this month, compared with a 0.21 percent return for sovereign notes, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Company debt worldwide has gained 0.13 percent. BOJ Outlook The yen dropped to 82.84 per dollar last week, the weakest since April 4, and traded at 81.95 as of 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo. Sixteen of 22 economists surveyed this month by Bloomberg News forecast the BOJ will expand monetary easing at its next meeting on Dec. 19-20. The central bank refrained on Nov. 20 from increasing the 66 trillion-yen asset-purchase program that buys securities including government debt maturing in three years or less. A government auction of two-year notes yesterday drew bids valued at 13.9 times the amount on offer, near a seven-year high. The BOJ’s purchases have driven down one- to three-year yields to about 0.1 percent, almost matching the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans in the money market. The nation’s 20-year debt yields climbed to 95 basis points above 10-year securities on Nov. 16, the highest since July 1999, steepening the so-called yield curve. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point. ‘Substantial Expansion’ “Abe’s remarks on extreme reflationary policy are leading to speculation of a substantial expansion in the BOJ’s monetary easing, which is causing short-term yields to fall,” said Tokio Marine ’s Take. “This sort of policy may boost inflation expectations.” Among the 12 sovereign markets tracked by the Ministry of Finance, France attracted the most demand from Japanese investors after the U.S. They bought a net 2.84 trillion yen of long-term French government debt this year through September. That would be the largest yearly purchase on record going back to 2005. Japanese investors increased holdings of France’s bonds even after Standard & Poor’s in January stripped the nation of its AAA rating. Moody’s Investors Service followed on Nov. 19, cutting the nation’s Aaa grade to Aa1 with a negative outlook. Kokusai’s Holdings Kokusai Asset Management Co.’s Global Sovereign Open Fund boosted its holdings of France ’s debt in the year through October to 2.2 percent of the total after selling them at the height of the region’s financial woes in 2011, according to reports posted on the company’s website. The $18.2 billion fund cut German and Dutch debt by 2.2 percentage points and 2.3 percentage points respectively during the same period. France’s 10-year bonds yield 2.2 percent for Japanese investors who hedge against a fluctuation in the euro. Rates on similar-maturity debt in Japan were 0.72 percent today, matching the nine-year low reached July 23. “I’m relatively optimistic about Europe now because the region’s debt crisis is unlikely to spark a crash in the financial market,” said Masataka Horii, who runs Asia ’s biggest bond fund at Kokusai in Tokyo. France’s bonds are one of the sovereign securities he would consider buying if he decides to add to his euro-holdings, he said.

{"headline": "Mitsubishi Heavy Said to Scrap Merger Talks With Hitachi After Media Leaks", "article": "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) and Hitachi Ltd. (6501) said they’re not holding talks to merge some of their businesses, hours after the president of Hitachi said that a deal was being discussed. Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan ’s largest maker of heavy machinery, said it has no plan to agree to any merger. Hitachi, the nation’s second-largest manufacturer by revenue, said in a separate statement that no talks were in progress. The statements were released after Hitachi President Hiroaki Nakanishi’s televised comments on Tokyo Broadcasting System. Shares of the companies, whose combined annual sales exceed $150 billion, rose in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper first reported they planned to discuss merging businesses including nuclear power plants and railway systems. Mitsubishi Heavy called off the talks after the media reports, a person familiar with the matter said. “The shares are higher as investors still believe that they will reach agreement at some point,” said Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The reported merger would benefit both by complementing each other.” Hitachi rose 1.7 percent to 471 yen as of the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo trading, extending its gain this year to 8.8 percent. Mitsubishi Heavy, which has risen 18 percent in 2011, traded 3.4 percent higher. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock Average gained 0.2 percent. Nakanishi’s Confirmation Footage on TBS showed Nakanishi saying “yes” when asked by reporters whether Hitachi was holding merger talks with Mitsubishi Heavy. He said an announcement would be made later today, according to the broadcast. Mitsubishi Heavy and Hitachi have worked together in the past. They merged their steelmaking equipment units in 2000 and combined their hydroelectric power equipment units last year. The two companies were planning to discuss a merger of some operations, including nuclear power plants and railway systems, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming part of the earlier Nikkei report. Such a combination would benefit both companies because they’d complement each other, David Rubenstein , a Tokyo-based analyst at MF Global FXA Securities Ltd., wrote in a report. The deal would help accelerate Hitachi’s reforms in its power-system operations, while improving Mitsubishi Heavy’s profit margins and execution, he wrote. Largest Infrastructure Firm An alliance would have led to the creation of one of the world’s largest infrastructure companies as Japanese manufacturers reel from this year’s deadly earthquake, tsunami and strong yen, according to the Nikkei. Questions about the future of nuclear power after the Fukushima reactor meltdowns in March and Japan’s surging yen helped spur the talks, Nikkei said. Both had seen the atomic industry as a source of growth, the newspaper reported. Regulators would have to approve a merger, Nikkei said. Hitachi’s products include communications and electronic equipment, industrial machinery and consumer electronics. In March it agreed to sell its hard-disk drive unit to Western Digital Corp. (WDC) for about $4.3 billion in cash and stock, the company’s largest disposal on record. The sale was part of plans to trim some of Hitachi’s hundreds of businesses to focus on power plants, trains and other infrastructure projects. The company yesterday said it may stop making televisions. Earnings, Market Value Hitachi reported revenue of 9.3 trillion yen ($118 billion) last year and has a market value of 2.1 trillion yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mitsubishi Heavy posted sales of 2.9 trillion yen and is valued at 1.2 trillion yen. “Hitachi has done some restructuring in the past, but putting two horribly run companies together in order to survive is music to my ears,” said Winston Barnes , director of sales and trading for Asian markets at WJB Capital Group Inc. in San Francisco. “The merger of some units is not expected until April 2013. They will undoubtedly deny the reports.” To contact the reporters on this story: Yoshinori Eki in Tokyo at  yeki@bloomberg.net ; Naoko Fujimura in 東京 at  nfujimura@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "일본의 대표적인 중공업 기업인 미쓰비시 중공업과 히타치가 합병을 논의한 적이 있었나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "히타치와 미쓰비시 중공업의 합병이 성사되었다면, 두 기업의 비즈니스 모델과 수익 창출 방식에 어떤 영향을 미쳤을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "일본의 대표적인 중공업 기업인 미쓰비시 중공업과 히타치가 합병을 논의한 배경에는 어떤 거시적 환경과 산업 구조 변화가 있었을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "Deutsche Bank Accused of Improper Swap Sales in Unitech Lawsuit", "article": "Unitech Ltd. (UT) , an Indian property developer, accused Deutsche Bank AG of selling it an interest- rate swap that wasn’t suitable and wasn’t properly explained, according to a London lawsuit over a $150 million loan deal. Unitech filed a counterclaim in May arguing Deutsche Bank was negligent to sell an unsuitable hedging agreement, and owed damages that canceled out its debt, according to court documents. Germany ’s biggest bank had earlier sued Unitech saying a unit of the company owes $11 million under the swap contract and has missed payments. Deutsche Bank “knew, or must have appreciated, that it was likely to make significant amounts of money” from the contract at Unitech’s expense, the Indian company said in its lawsuit. Interest-rate swaps that turned out to be costly for customers and profitable for banks have led to hundreds of lawsuits and an investigation by the U.K. Financial Services Authority into how they were sold. Unitech’s suit is one of the largest to reach the U.K. courts. The issue has affected bank customers from British seaside cafes to municipal governments including Milan in Italy and Jefferson County, Alabama. “There is a large spectrum of misselling claims in terms of amounts and sophistication of customers,” said Max Hotham, an attorney at Enyo Law LLP in London, who isn’t involved in the Unitech case. His largest U.K. case involves a 1 billion-euro ($1.26 billion) swap, he said in a phone interview. “The scale of this thing is enormous.” Unitech’s lawyer Paul Friedman and Libby Young, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, both declined to comment. Spiraling Costs The swaps are supposed to protect borrowers from a rise in interest rates by converting floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. Customers can face spiraling costs if rates drop or move more than expected. Unitech said in the lawsuit its managers didn’t have any experience with interest-rate swaps and Deutsche Bank hadn’t explained the risks. Total payments under the agreement were at least $23.5 million between 2007, when it was signed, and 2010, Unitech said. That sum showed “the transaction was not a suitable hedge.” The case is: Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) v.

PPL will pay 3.5 billion pounds in cash and assume 500 million pounds of existing debt in its acquisition of Central Networks, the second-biggest U.K. utility grid, the companies said in separate statements. E.ON and PPL said they expect to close the transaction in early April. The acquisition marks PPL’s second purchase of assets from Dusseldorf-based E.ON in less than a year. The company, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, agreed last April to buy two U.S. utilities from E.ON for $6.7 billion. E.ON, Germany ’s largest utility, is selling assets as it seeks to raise 15 billion euros ($21 billion) by the end of 2013 to cut debt and fund international expansion. After the transaction is completed, PPL will own the largest electric distribution network in the U.K. in terms of regulated asset value, the company said in its statement. The deal will add about 10 cents to 15 cents a share to 2011 earnings, according to PPL. PPL already owns a U.K. grid unit with 83,000 kilometers (50,000 miles) of power lines that serve 2.6 million customers in south Wales and southwest England, according to its website. E.ON’s U.K. grid has 133,000 kilometers of power lines that serve more than 5 million customers in central England , according to its website.

{"headline": "Van Der Moolen Governance Was Flawed Before Bankruptcy, Dutch Probe Says", "article": "Van der Moolen Holding NV (MOO) lacked sufficient risk management and its governance had flaws in the period leading up to the Dutch stockbroker’s bankruptcy in 2009, according to an investigation ordered by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Appeals Court. Managers didn’t seem in control of Van der Moolen’s dividend-arbitrage activities, and attention to capital management and external financing was limited, court-appointed investigators Kees Scholtes and Sietze Hepkema said in a report dated May 13 and obtained by Bloomberg News today. The period under investigation ran from January 2005 to September 2009, when the 117-year-old Dutch stockbroker was declared bankrupt after posting three straight years of losses. Dutch investor group VEB and insurer ASR Nederland NV asked the Enterprise Chamber to investigate the firm’s management. They now can ask the court to assert mismanagement, which may lead to damage claims. The firm operated without a chief executive officer or management board after Richard den Drijver stepped down on July 16, 2009, leaving supervisory board members Peter Zwart and Arjen Paardekoper temporarily in charge. Den Drijver acted as a managing director and major shareholder rather than as CEO of a listed company, the investigators said. Board Departures Scholtes and Hepkema “regret” that they didn’t get to interview Den Drijver, they said. There were signs Den Drijver didn’t accept critical comments from other executive board members, illustrated partly by the departure of two existing board members within a year after he took the helm, according to the report. The company canceled the acquisition of stakes in GSFS Asset Management BV and Global Securities Arbitrage BV in March 2009, saying the moves “will not lead to the intended positive impact on the shareholders’ value of Van der Moolen.” Van der Moolen’s administrator Paul Schaink didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. Van der Moolen was founded on July 1, 1892, by F.J. van der Moolen as a stockbroker, according to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It became the No. 4 market maker on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001 after buying specialists including Cohen, Duffy, McGowan & Co. and Scavone, McKenna, Cloud & Co. Van der Moolen transferred its unprofitable NYSE specialist unit to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) in December 2007, quitting floor trading in New York after more than a decade as a switch to electronic dealing eroded the traditional business.

{"headline": "Wheat Drops, Paring Weekly Climb, as U.S. Raises World Production Outlook", "article": "Wheat fell in Chicago , paring a third weekly climb, after the U.S. government raised its outlook for global supplies on higher-than-expected production in Europe and Russia. Global output will come to 672.1 million metric tons in the 2011-12 season, more than the 662.4 million tons estimated last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Stockpiles will be 188.9 million tons, up from 182.2 million tons, it said. Wheat reached a two-week low on Aug. 9 as commodities plunged after the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating. “The gloomy financial context and large wheat stocks are putting the prices under pressure,” Bourges, France-based farm adviser Offre et Demande Agricole said on its website today. “The harvest is progressing in France thanks to the improvement of weather conditions.” Wheat for December delivery dropped 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $7.30 a bushel by 12:08 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade, cutting this week’s climb to 1 percent. November-delivery milling wheat fell 1.50 euros, or 0.8 percent, to 196 euros ($279) a ton on NYSE Liffe in France’s capital. The wheat harvest in Russia, which ended an export ban last month, will total 56 million tons, 3 million tons more than estimated last month, the USDA said. The European Union’s crop will reach 133.5 million tons, above the 132.1 million tons forecast last month, it said. Higher Stockpile Ratio “The world wheat projections were bearish,” Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said in a report today. The global stocks-to-use ratio of 28 percent is “comfortably” higher than the 2007-08 level of about 20 percent, he said. Corn for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $7.115 a bushel in Chicago after climbing as high as $7.20, the highest price for the most-active contract since June 9. Global harvests of corn will total 860.5 million tons in the 2011-12 season, 11.9 million tons below last month’s estimate, the USDA said, paring its output forecast for the U.S. by 4.1 percent. Demand is predicted to outpace production by 8.4 million tons, more than the 5.2 million-ton deficit forecast in July, the USDA data showed. Production in the U.S., which is estimated to grow 38 percent of the world’s corn, will total 12.91 billion bushels (328 million tons), compared with 13.47 billion projected in July, the USDA said. The average prediction of 31 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 13.08 billion bushels. Last year’s crop was 12.45 billion bushels. The yield estimate was cut to 153 bushels an acre from 158.7 in July. “With weather disappointing during both the U.S. planting and growing season, prices will need to rally further to adjust demand down to the lower available supplies,” Damien Courvalin and Allison Nathan , analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a report yesterday. Soybeans for November delivery were unchanged at $13.3175 a bushel.

{"headline": "Canada December Manufacturing Sales Report (Text)", "article": "The following is the text of Canada 's manufacturing shipments report for December released by Statistics Canada. Manufacturing sales advanced 0.6% to $49.9 billion in December, the fifth increase in six months. The transportation equipment industry led the gain. Sales increased in 12 of 21 industries representing about two-thirds of Canadian manufacturing. The gains occurred primarily in durable goods industries, where sales rose 2.1%. Sales of non-durable goods fell 0.9%. In terms of constant dollars, manufacturing sales rose 1.2%, representing an increase in the volume of manufactured goods. This was the fifth increase in constant dollar sales in six months. Manufacturing sales advance With December's increase, monthly sales for 7 of 21 manufacturing industries have reached or surpassed levels recorded in October 2008, the onset of the recent economic downturn. The largest of the seven industries includes transportation equipment, food, petroleum and coal products, and machinery manufacturing. Combined, these four represented 51% of total manufacturing in December. December's sales, at $49.9 billion, were just short of the pre-downturn total of $50.2 billion in October 2008. For 2011 as a whole, manufacturing sales amounted to $571 billion, up 7.8% from 2010. The main contributors to the annual increase included higher sales in the petroleum and coal products, primary metal, machinery and transportation equipment industries. Motor vehicle industry records highest sales since November 2007 Sales by motor vehicle manufacturers advanced 2.9% in December to $4.3 billion, the highest monthly sales level since November 2007. In addition, sales in the motor vehicle parts industry rose 5.5% to $1.9 billion. The transportation equipment industry as a whole had the largest dollar gains of any industry, with a 3.7% increase in sales to $8.5 billion. This was the seventh consecutive monthly increase. Plastics and rubber products sales increased 7.5% to $2.1 billion, their highest level since August 2007. The rise reflected higher sales volumes. Greater sales volumes were entirely responsible for a 2.7% increase in the primary metal industry to $4.2 billion, the third consecutive monthly gain. The overall sales increase was partly offset by a 5.6% decline among petroleum and coal product manufacturers to $6.9 billion. A portion of the decrease was the result of a 3.7% decline in prices for petroleum and coal products, as measured by the Industrial Product Price Index. Central Canada accounted for most of the increase Manufacturing sales rose in four provinces in December. Most of the sales increase was located in Central Canada. Combined sales in Ontario and Quebec were up $741 million while sales declined $445 million in the rest of Canada. With the gains in December, Ontario, Alberta , Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan surpassed their sales levels recorded in October 2008. In Ontario, sales rose 2.1% to $22.9 billion, the third consecutive monthly increase and the highest level since September 2008. The increase was largely the result of a 6.5% advance in the primary metal industry, a 5.5% gain in the motor vehicle parts industry, and a 2.3% rise in the motor vehicle industry. Gains in the machinery and miscellaneous manufacturing industries also contributed to Ontario's sales for December. A decline in production in the aerospace product and parts industry offset a portion of the provincial increase. Sales in Quebec rose 2.3% to $12.0 billion, the fourth increase in five months. A 17.9% increase in the transportation equipment industry was behind a large portion of the provincial growth. The plastics and rubber products, machinery, and primary metal industries also recorded sales increases. A 13.5% decline in sales reported by petroleum and coal products manufacturers partly offset the gains in Quebec. In Alberta, sales declined 3.5% to $6.3 billion, mostly as a result of lower sales in the machinery industry. After a sales peak in November, the machinery industry declined 23.4% to $776 million. Sales fell 4.8% in New Brunswick and 10.0% in Newfoundland and Labrador, reflecting declines reported in the non-durable goods industries. Inventory levels down Inventory levels decreased 0.9% in December to $64.4 billion, the first decline after 14 months of increases. Inventories declined in 14 of 21 industries, with non- durable goods down 0.7% and durable goods down 1.0%. Primary metal inventories declined 2.0% to $7.7 billion. In the food industry , inventories decreased 2.3%, owing in part to lower stocks in the grain and oilseed milling industry. The declines were partially offset by higher inventory levels reported by motor vehicle, fabricated metal product, and chemical manufacturers. Inventories decline The inventory-to-sales ratio fell to 1.29 in December from 1.31 in November. The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time, in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level. The inventory-to-sales ratio decreases Unfilled orders decrease Unfilled orders declined 1.6% to $60.8 billion in December. The decrease was largely the result of declines in the transportation equipment (-1.3%) and the primary metal (-8.7%) industries. In the transportation equipment industry, unfilled orders were down 1.0% for aerospace product and parts and 2.4% for railroad rolling stock. Unfilled orders decrease New orders New orders decreased 2.8% in December to $49.0 billion, following a 4.2% gain in November. The decline in new orders was concentrated in the aerospace product and parts industry. Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. Preliminary data are provided for the current reference month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for the three previous months. Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics and rubber products. Durable goods industries include wood products, non- metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous manufacturing. Production-based industries For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries, the value of production is used instead of sales of goods manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories of goods in process and finished products manufactured. Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled. New orders are those received whether sold in the current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the previous month to the current month.

{"headline": "Gay Maine Candidate’s Coming Out May Help Topple LePage", "article": "Paul LePage, Maine ’s Republican governor, stridently opposed last November’s referendum that legalized same-sex marriage in his state and later used a crude reference to sodomy to criticize an adversary. Now, he’s in danger of losing his job next year to an opponent who revealed his homosexuality yesterday in a newspaper article. The declaration by Democratic U.S. Representative Michael Michaud, a leading contender in the 2014 election for governor, keeps Maine -- known for lobster, vacation spots and sober politics -- in the vanguard of America’s swift cultural shift. Residents in 2010 elected LePage, a favorite of Tea Party groups who promised to tell President Barack Obama to “go to hell.” Two years later, same-sex marriage won by popular vote. Next year, the state may elect the first openly gay governor. Michaud, 58, who represents the more rural of Maine’s two districts, made his sexual preference known yesterday in an op-ed piece he sent to the state’s three largest newspapers. In it, he accused opponents of engaging in a whisper campaign against him. “They want people to question whether I am gay,” he wrote. “Yes, I am. But why should it matter?” Local media reported that he told his mother only hours before the article was published. ‘Personal Decision’ In an interview with the Portland Press Herald, Michaud, who is from a Catholic family, elaborated on why he made the announcement. “It’s a personal decision,” he said. “It’s one I wish I didn’t have to make. I thought it was important for me to let the people of the state of Maine know upfront.” A Michaud victory would be another in a mounting list of successes for the gay-rights movement, including one yesterday when the U.S. Senate agreed to vote on banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that kept the federal government from providing benefits to same-sex couples. The number of states allowing gay marriage has more than doubled in the past year to 14, including New Jersey, where Republican Governor Chris Christie declined to fight a court ruling allowing it. ‘Moving Forward’ “The country is moving forward in acceptance toward our community in an extraordinarily rapid way,” said Marc Solomon, the national campaign director for Freedom to Marry, a New York-based gay-rights organization. “There is some real pride a lot of people have in showing that America is an open and accepting place.” Michaud’s disclosure makes him the seventh openly gay member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Senate’s Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, is gay. Among local officials, Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who leads the country’s fourth-biggest city, is a lesbian. If he wins, Michaud could be the first openly homosexual person elected to governor in the U.S. In Maryland , where Democratic state Representative Heather Mizeur is an openly gay candidate for governor, the Democratic establishment is rallying behind Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown. In Michaud’s campaign, being gay could be an asset rather than a liability, according to political analysts. He’s well known and liked in the northern reaches of the state, which he has represented for a decade, yet he has had trouble generating enthusiasm from Democrats in Portland and southern counties. “Mike is seen as a fairly conservative guy,” said Dennis Bailey, who was a spokesman for U.S. Senator Angus King, a political independent, when King was governor. “In the southern district, where voters tend to be more liberal, Mike was viewed with some suspicion. This helps secure those voters.” Voter Support Losing traditional supporters in the north isn’t a large concern because of the depth of Michaud’s popularity in his district, Bailey said. Besides, he said, rumors that Michaud was gay had long circulated in state politics. LePage, 65, won in 2010 with 38 percent of the vote in a five-way race. The governor dropped in voter surveys after a summer of verbal misfires, including alluding to sodomy while criticizing Democratic lawmaker Troy Jackson, who opposed him during a budget battle. “Senator Jackson claims to be for the people, but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline,” LePage told a local television station. Next year’s ballot will have three major candidates. LePage is running, as is Eliot Cutler, an independent. Cutler, 67, came in second in 2010, taking 36 percent of the vote. An August survey by Public Policy Polling in Raleigh, North Carolina, had Michaud with 39 percent, LePage with 35 percent and Cutler with 18 percent, with a 3.2 percentage point margin of error. Obama, a Democrat, won the state twice. Early Positioning “Cutler had been trying to run to Michaud’s left and show that Michaud is inadequately progressive on social issues,” said Amy Fried, who teaches politics at the University of Maine in Orono. “This announcement undercuts that.” Cutler’s campaign said in a statement that Michaud’s declaration “has no bearing whatsoever on a candidate’s qualifications to be governor.” Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to LePage, had no comment. Mill Worker Analysts said Michaud would lose any advantage if his campaign dwells on the issue. “He is not going to be the ‘gay candidate,’” said Bailey, the president of Savvy Inc., a political consulting firm in Portland. “He will work very hard to be the mill worker from northern Maine. His intent is to get this out early and be done with it. I don’t think Mike will be raising the rainbow flag anytime soon.” Another benefit for Michaud could be fundraising. The measure to approve same-sex marriage in Maine drew $8.8 million from groups backing gay rights, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, a Helena, Montana-based nonprofit that tracks spending on ballot questions. The 2012 initiative won with 51 percent of the vote, overturning a ban backed by 53 percent of voters in 2009. Support from national gay-rights groups came quickly. “We applaud congressman Michaud and look forward to working with him in the future,” said Chuck Wolfe, chief executive officer of the Washington-based Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. The group raised $4 million last year for gay and lesbian candidates, according to Jeff Spitko, a spokesman.

{"headline": "Nomura `1-Trillion-Yen' Japan Fund Falls Below 100 Billion Yen Asset Value", "article": "Nomura Asset Management Co. ’s once- dubbed “1-Trillion-Yen Fund” fell yesterday to its lowest level since being introduced in 2000 at the height of a bubble in information-technology stocks.  The “Nomura Japan Stock Strategy Fund” saw its net asset value fall to 99.7 billion yen ($1.15 billion) as of July 22 as individual investors shifted their cash into foreign equities, said Chiho Shimada , chief editor of Toshi Shintaku Jijo, an investment magazine. Dividend yields for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index and Euro STOXX 50 Index are more than 4 percent compared with about 1.7 percent for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The Nikkei has declined 10.6 percent this year.  “The poor performance of Japan’s stocks is one of the reasons for the unpopularity of the fund,” said Shimada. “Another is that Japanese stocks have low distribution rates because of low dividend yields. People are investing for monthly returns.”  The fund started in February 2000, just before the information technology bubble burst. It attracted 792.4 billion yen from investors before it began operation.  Sales of Japanese stocks funds have been falling, according to the Investment Trust Association, Japan. Domestic equity funds at open-end investment trusts posted 13 consecutive months of net asset outflow as of June as redemptions and cancellations exceeded sales, the association’s data show.

{"headline": "Dutch Pension Fund ABP Sues Deutsche Bank Over Securities", "article": "Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Europe ’s second-biggest pension fund, sued Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) for fraud, claiming it bought residential mortgage-backed securities relying on the bank’s allegedly false and misleading statements. Deutsche Bank made false and misleading statements about underwriting standards and practices, loan-to-value ratios, appraisals and owner-occupancy statistics, Heerlen, Netherlands- based ABP said in a complaint filed today in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. “ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly less than represented, that had been made to borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been represented,” according to the complaint. Last month, Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America filed a lawsuit claiming it had invested in securities unaware that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank internally viewed the loans and securities as “pigs.” Dexia SA, the lender rescued by France and Belgium in 2008, filed a similar suit in July in connection with more than $1 billion in residential mortgage- backed securities. ABP, which made the purchases in 2006 and 2007, said it had suffered “substantial damages” as a result and is seeking an award that includes loss of market value and principal and interest payments. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said in a phone interview that the company will fight the suit, which it believes is without merit. ABP oversees the pensions of 2.8 million Dutch state employees, including teachers and firemen. It oversaw about 242 billion euros ($341 billion) in assets at the end of June. The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Ace Securities Corp., 652460/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).

{"headline": "U.S. Stocks Advance on Stimulus Bets Before Jobs Report", "article": "U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erasing earlier losses to snap a two-day losing streak, as investors weighed the Federal Reserve’s stimulus plans before a report on employment growth tomorrow. All 10 industries in the S&P 500 advanced. Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. added at least 1.6 percent as phone stocks gained the most as a group. Banks and health-care companies jumped 1.4 percent. Costco Wholesale Corp. rose 1.8 percent after reporting an increase in sales. VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  plunged 21 percent as the maker of credit-card terminals forecast earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. The S&P 500 (SPX) added 0.9 percent to 1,622.56 at 4 p.m. in New York after falling as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 80.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 15,040.62. Almost 6.9 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges today, 8.7 percent higher than the three-month average. “The U.S. markets are going through a transition from being liquidity driven to a rally based on fundamental data and that’s a very bumpy ride,” Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at JP Morgan Funds, where he helps oversee about $400 billion, said via phone. “Investors are trying to figure out whether we are now pricing in earnings and the jobs situation or whether it’s still the Fed leading markets. So we’re slowly taking off the training wheels and that makes things a little wobbly.” Fed Liquidity The Fed stimulus and better-than-expected earnings have propelled the bull market in U.S. equities into a fifth year and driven the S&P 500 up 140 percent from a 12-year low in 2009. The gauge has dropped 2.8 percent since closing at a record high on May 21, the day before Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke suggested the central bank could curtail its $85 billion in monthly bond buying if the job market improves in a “real and sustainable way.” A Labor Department report tomorrow is expected to indicate employers added 163,000 to non-farm payrolls last month, almost equal to the gain in April. The agency issued data today that showed jobless claims decreased by 11,000 to 346,000 in the week ended June 1. The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 345,000. Data yesterday showed companies in the U.S. hired fewer workers than projected in May. “It’s wait-and-see before the jobs report tomorrow,” Frank Ingarra , head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $1.6 billion. “It all depends on how traders will read that data and its effect on the Fed’s decision making. We need to be assured that the Fed will not taper off monetary stimulus or we need to see significant improvement in the economy to get the next leg up in the rally.” Draghi Comments European equities fell today after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said policy makers left additional stimulus measures “on the shelf.” The euro-area will return to growth by the end of they year, Draghi said at a press conference after the ECB kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low. “The improving jobless report in the U.S. and Draghi’s statement created fear that the central banks will unwind monetary easing because things are getting better,” Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets as the chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New York, said via phone. Moving Averages Selling in U.S. equities gained momentum earlier today as the S&P 500 briefly dropped below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April. That level, currently at 1,605.35, is watched by speculators. The benchmark index plunged 1.4 percent yesterday to the lowest since May 2 and the Dow dropped 217 points for its biggest decline since April 15. The Dow today also slipped below its trading average of 14,923.91 for the past 50 days. That was the first time this year it happened for the 30-stock gauge. “There’s some trader anxiety lingering from yesterday’s big move down,” Michael James, a managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said in an interview. “The market is testing the 50-day moving average on the S&P 500.” The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX) , fell 5 percent to 16.63. The benchmark gauge for American stock options, which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, rose as much as 5.8 percent today, briefly erasing its loss for the year as it traded above the 2012 close of 18.02. The index has fallen 7.7 percent this year and touched a six-year low in March. Phone stocks surged 2.2 percent. Verizon jumped 3.5 percent to $49.97, its biggest advance since August 2011.

{"headline": "U.S. ‘Disturbed’ by China's Trial of Dissdent's Nephew", "article": "The U.S. is “deeply disturbed” by reports that Chinese courts have sentenced the nephew of blind dissident Chen Guangcheng to more than three years in prison and is urging a review of the case, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. China sentenced Chen Kegui to 39 months in prison yesterday after being convicted of assault for injuring government officials who had stormed into his home in April to search for his uncle, who had fled house arrest and sought sanctuary at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. The nephew’s trial “lacked basic due process guarantees” and failed to meet either Chinese or international standards, Nuland told reporters in Washington yesterday. She said that the 33-year-old Chen Kegui wasn’t represented by legal counsel of his own choosing and that Chinese officials warned lawyers who volunteered to represent him that their licenses would be suspended if they did so. “This was a deeply flawed legal process that convicted him and sentenced him to three years in prison,” Nuland said. “We regret China’s failure to honor its international commitments and we call on them to review this case.” International human rights groups also expressed strong criticism of the Chinese actions. Amnesty International yesterday called the sentencing “obvious retaliation for his uncle’s escape from house arrest last spring.” Rights Tests “Prosecuting Chen Guangcheng’s nephew was a test of China’s respect for the rule of law, and both the nephew, Chen Kegui, and the rule of law lost,” Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch said on the group’s website. “This case bore the same disturbing hallmarks as Chen Guangcheng’s persecution – incommunicado detention, denial of lawyers of his choice, and a politicized and closed trial.” The case “suggests that the new leadership in Beijing can’t or won’t follow through on commitments to investigate local officials implicated in wrongdoing and egregious human rights abuses,” said Richardson. The elder Chen clashed with authorities in his native Shandong Province over his campaign against the official family planning policy of forced abortion. The dissident, blind since birth, has expressed concern that his nephew would be made to pay the price for his escape from house arrest and the embarrassment he brought the Chinese government. Visiting lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Aug. 1, Chen said his nephew’s case “is essentially a continuance of my own case.” Self Defense Chen, who now studies law at New York University, and other family members have said the younger Chen was acting in self- defense. “After I had escaped house arrest, local government officials and their hired thugs broke into his home,” the dissident said in Washington in August. “In order to protect himself and to avoid being beaten to death by those thugs,” the younger man “was compelled to defend himself using a kitchen knife.” The trial dredges up one of the most difficult moments in Sino-U.S. diplomacy in years, as Chen’s escape to the embassy came shortly before a May visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to discuss strategic and economic issues. Clinton, speaking Nov. 29 in Washington , recalled that “an already delicate trip had become an outsized test of the U.S.- China relationship.” In the end, Clinton said, “the relationship we’ve worked so hard to build with China proved more durable and dynamic than many feared” and they weathered the storm Chen’s escape created. Chen, along with U.S. officials and lawmakers, has presented the fallout from Chen’s flight to the embassy as a litmus test for the Chinese legal system. Speaking at the Aug. 1 press conference while flanked by leading House Republicans and Democrats, Chen said that, “if a case as high profile as mine cannot be properly handled in accordance with Chinese law and with international legal norms, how are we able to believe that China will respect human rights and their rule of law?” To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Nicole Gaouette in Washington at  ngaouette@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott in Washington at jwalcott9@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "중국 정부의 강제 낙태 정책에 반대하는 캠페인을 벌인 천광청과 그의 조카의 사례는 어떤 인권 문제를 제기하나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "천광청의 조카가 정부 관리들을 다치게 한 혐의로 유죄 판결을 받은 사건은 중국의 법치주의와 인권 상황에 대해 어떤 시사점을 제공하나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "천광청과 그의 조카의 사례는 중국과 미국 간의 외교 관계에 어떤 영향을 미쳤으며, 이는 두 나라의 전략적, 경제적 협력에 어떤 함의를 지니나요?"}]}

{"headline": "South Africa’s Producer-Price Inflation Unchanged in May", "article": "South African producer prices rose 6.6 percent in May from a year earlier, more than economists forecast, adding to pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged. The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose at a the same pace as in April, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its website today. That was above the 6.3 percent median estimate nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices gained 0.5 percent in the month. The Reserve Bank has left its benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 5.5 percent since November 2010 to help support Africa ’s biggest economy while keeping price pressures in check. Governor Gill Marcus said on June 8 the rand’s depreciation is the main risk to inflation, making it difficult for the central bank to lower borrowing costs as global growth slows. “The risks emanate from a weaker exchange rate , which could see PPI pick up in the latter part of the year,” Shireen Darmalingam, an economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed note to clients. “We maintain that interest rates will remain on hold through to the second half of 2013.” Consumer-price inflation slowed to 5.7 percent in May, near the top of the bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range. The rand dropped 8.8 percent against the dollar to 8.523 in May, driving up producers’ costs of imported goods by 8.3 percent, the statistics agency said. The currency was at 8.42 against the dollar as of 1:15 p.m. in Johannesburg, little changed from 8.4247 before the data was released. The yield on the R157 bond due in 2015 fell 2 basis points to 6.01 percent. Traders are increasing bets that the bank will cut rates by the end of the year as inflation slows and the European debt crisis curbs economic growth. The yield on the forward-rate agreement due in December fell 27 basis points to 5.25 percent in the past month. To contact the reporter on this story: Andres R.

{"headline": "New Zealand Carbon Credit Prices Unchanged as Buyers Choose CERs", "article": "The spot price of emission credits in New Zealand ’s carbon market remained little changed last week as buyers opted for contracts in the global United Nations- backed market, Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said. Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$19.20 ($14.57) a metric ton today, unchanged from a week earlier, the broker said today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with 11.47 euros ($15.59) for UN Certified Emission Reduction credits on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange in London yesterday. New Zealand credit holders are waiting for spot prices to rise, shunting buyers to the CER market, the broker said. Buyers are also choosing CERs for forward contracts because the market is more liquid and the price isn’t capped, the statement said. New Zealand companies that emit greenhouse gases have the option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy the contracts. “The attraction of buying the CER forwards even at a premium is the fact they are very liquid, exchange traded, have global interest and are not capped at NZ$25,” the statement said. New Zealand credits will continue to trade in a tight range in the short-term, with support at the lower level and CER prices dictating the upper limit, the broker said.

{"headline": "European Gasoline Drops; Fuel Oil Premium Advances: Oil Products", "article": "Gasoline fell in northwest Europe as Glencore International Plc (GLEN) sold on the barge market. Gasoil gained on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as Brent advanced. Low-sulfur fuel oil’s premium to the high- sulfur grade widened to the most in more than four months. Light Products Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam- Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,090 and $1,094 a metric ton, according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s at the lower end of deals yesterday from $1,089 to $1,103. Trafigura Beheer BV purchased 13,000 tons of the 17,000 tons that changed hands. The trades are for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Barge deals are typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons. Gasoline’s premium to Brent declined by 4 cents to $14.26 a barrel as of 11:08 a.m. local time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. “In Europe we are watching the water levels on the Rhine which are falling and should accentuate the short-loading of barges and result in some product backing-up in the ARA region,” Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, said today in a note. Barge freight rates for gasoline to be transported from the ARA-region to Frankfurt rose to 16.80 euros ($21) a ton yesterday compared with 15.80 euros on Aug. 15, according to PJK International BV, a researcher, said by e-mail. A 2,000-ton barge can only load 1,200 tons of product, Patrick Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone today. Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $7.70 a barrel from $7.26 yesterday, PVM data show. Middle Distillates Gasoil for delivery in September rose $3.50, or 0.4 percent, to $982.50 a ton on ICE as of 1:18 p.m. London time. The more actively traded October contract was at $983 a ton, putting the market in contango after being at parity for the past three days. Contango is a structure where later-dated deliveries are more expensive than near-term supplies and may signal a future supply constraint or increase in demand. Gasoil’s crack , a measure of refining profitability, declined to $17.60 a barrel from $17.50 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent increased 0.6 percent to $114.37 a barrel.

{"headline": "Stanford Investor Class Actions Restored by Appeals Court", "article": "R. Allen Stanford’s aggrieved investors can press state court class-action lawsuits they filed seeking to recover losses in his $7 billion international fraud scheme, a U.S. appeals court ruled. The New Orleans based panel today reversed a lower-court decision that the claims were barred by a federal law preventing plaintiffs from pursuing state-law claims arising from the purchase or sale of federally regulated securities. A federal court jury in Houston on March 6 found Stanford guilty of mail and wire fraud in the sale of certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. He is to be sentenced June 14. The purchase or sale of securities is only “tangentially related” to Stanford’s scheme, the unanimous three-judge panel said , reviving four lawsuits filed against those who sold the CDs and lawyers and an insurer for the Stanford bank. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Stanford and two other top executives in his organization in February 2009, alleging they misled investors about the nature and oversight of the Antiguan bank and the CDs it issued. He and other executives were indicted on federal charges four months later. Finance chief James Davis pleaded guilty to fraud in August 2009 and testified against Stanford in his six- week trial. U.S. District Judge David Godbey in Dallas , who has been overseeing the SEC case and related litigation, took jurisdiction over the investor claims removed from state to federal court. Lower-Court Ruling He dismissed them because Stanford advertised the CDs as being backed by regulated securities and some investors sold securities to finance their CD purchases. Those facts put the CD-related suits in the ambit of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, the judge ruled. The appeals court disagreed. “We find that the fact that some of the plaintiffs sold some ‘covered securities’ in order to put their money in the CDs was not more than tangentially related to the fraudulent scheme,” the New Orleans panel said. The case is Roland v. Green, 11-10932, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans). To contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Harris in Chicago at  aharris16@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Bonds Erase ’13 Losses as Three-Decade Rally Defies Bears", "article": "Bonds of issuers worldwide from Morgan Stanley (MS) to the Spanish government have erased losses for 2013 as reports of the death of the three-decade bull market in the securities prove premature with the Federal Reserve maintaining its stimulus. Returns this month of 0.88 percent on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index bring gains since year-end to 0.4 percent. Seven weeks ago, before central bank policy makers surprised investors by delaying cuts in monthly purchases of $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, the measure was down 2.1 percent. Borrowing costs for corporate, sovereign and securitized debt have fallen to 1.92 percent, within 0.5 percentage point of historic lows, five months after Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Bill Gross said that the rally had probably ended. BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink said a scaling back of quantitative easing could come as late as next June. “As long as the Fed is buying, it provides liquidity in the bond market which spreads out into all asset classes,” Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego with LPL Financial Corp., which oversees $350 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Everything really does tie back to the U.S.” Pakistan, Brazil The gains are being led by corporate bonds, which have returned 1.43 percent this month versus an 0.81 percent gain for sovereign debt. Demand for emerging-market securities is building with Pakistan planning to raise as much as $1 billion in a bond sale, its first offering abroad since 2007, according to a Finance Ministry official, who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak publicly. Brazil sold $1.5 billion of dollar notes due 2025 to repurchase outstanding debt maturing from 2017 to 2030. It also exchanged $1.7 billion of bonds with holders of existing securities. As evidence of the reviving appetite for risk, safeguards on speculative-grade debt dropped to a record low last month as measured by a Moody’s Investors Service index of covenant quality. The index, which tracks bonds sold by North American companies, rose to an unprecedented 4.05 in September from 3.85 in August. A reading of 5 is the weakest and 1 is the strongest. Default Swaps Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting corporate debt from default in the U.S. increased, with the Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, adding 0.4 basis point to a mid-price of 72.4 basis points as of 10:46 a.m. in New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. A gauge of the health of U.S. financial conditions fell for a third day. The Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index, which combines everything from money-market rates to yields on government and corporate bonds to volatility in equities, decreased 0.02 to 1.48. The gauge, which falls as conditions deteriorate, reached 1.57 on Oct. 21, the highest in data dating back to January 1994. Verizon Bonds Bonds of Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today, accounting for 5.4 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1 million or more, Trace data show. The New York-based telephone carrier raised $49 billion on Sept. 11 in the largest corporate bond issue ever. The global bond market is poised for positive returns in 2013 for the first time since June following average gains of 5.4 percent in the five years ended last December, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Morgan Stanley’s $78.2 billion of bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index have gained 3.94 percent this year. The New York-based bank reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 18 that beat analysts’ estimates as equity-trading revenue jumped the most among the biggest Wall Street firms and profitability at its brokerage unit rose. Recession Ended The Spanish government’s $750.3 billion of securities on the index have gained 10.4 percent this year. Spain emerged from a two-year recession in the third quarter, with gross domestic product expanding 0.1 percent from the three months ended in June, when it shrank 0.1 percent, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain estimated in its monthly bulletin yesterday. Global returns have slowed from this year’s peak of 1.92 percent in May before Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke rattled markets by saying the central bank could taper record stimulus if the economy showed sustained improvement. As yields rose from a record low 1.51 percent, Gross, the manager of Pimco’s $250 billion Total Return Fund (PTTRX) , wrote in a Twitter post that a three-decade bull market in bonds probably ended April 29. Warren Buffett , the billionaire chairman and chief executive officer of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told Bloomberg Television in May that he felt “sorry” for fixed-income investors with yields on corporate bonds so low. ‘What’s Needed’ The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee refrained from reducing the pace of its monthly securities purchases on Sept. 18, with Bernanke saying the Fed must determine its policies based on “what’s needed for the economy,” even if it surprises markets. The central bank will delay the first reduction in its bond purchases until March after a government shutdown this month slowed fourth-quarter growth, economists said. Policy makers will pare the monthly pace of asset buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40 responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The 16-day budget impasse in Washington reduced growth by 0.3 percentage point this quarter, economists said in the survey. “It’s going to force the Federal Reserve to push off the tapering at the very least to March, but maybe as late as June,” Blackrock’s Fink said in an Oct. 16 interview on the CNBC television network. ‘Very Appealing’ Because the Fed may only have a “narrow window” to curtail stimulus as the economy struggles to recover, policy makers might consider whether to taper at all, Deutsche Bank AG strategist Jim Reid in London wrote in a research note dated yesterday. The global economy is forecast to grow 2.85 percent next year, after a 2.01 percent expansion in 2013, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. In the U.S., growth is expected to reach 2.6 percent from 1.6 percent this year. “We’re seeing a hard rally on the grounds the economy is growing well enough and the Fed’s taper strategy has been pushed further into the future,” Edward Marrinan, a macro credit strategist at RBS Securities, said in a telephone interview from Stamford , Connecticut. “All of that creates very appealing conditions for risk-takers to do their thing.” To contact the reporter on this story: Sarika Gangar in New York at  sgangar@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Alan Goldstein at  agoldstein5@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "연방준비제도의 경기부양책 유지가 글로벌 채권시장에 어떤 영향을 미쳤나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "빌 그로스의 채권시장 랠리 종료 예측에도 불구하고, 채권시장이 회복세를 보이는 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "연방준비제도의 테이퍼링 전략이 지연됨에 따라, 글로벌 경제 성장 전망과 리스크-리턴 구조에 어떤 변화가 예상되나요?"}]}

St. Louis right fielder Carlos Beltran recorded the first hit at the 37,442-seat stadium with a single in the top of the first inning and scored the first run on a two-run double by David Freese, the Most Valuable Player of the Cardinals’ seven- game World Series win against the Texas Rangers. “Tonight was fun,” Freese told reporters. “It’s always nice to get the season going and to open up here, beautiful ballpark, the fans were excited about it and so were we.” The Cardinals were playing their first game without manager Tony La Russa, who had led the team since 1996, and three-time National League MVP Albert Pujols, who left St. Louis to sign a free-agent deal with the Los Angeles Angels. Lohse allowed one run on two hits in 7 1/3 innings for the win. Marlins shortstop Jose Reyes, who signed with Miami as a free agent in December, broke up Lohse’s bid for a no-hitter with a single to center leading off the seventh inning. Beltran and Reyes were teammates on the New York Mets last season. The MLB season began with a two-game series in Tokyo last week between the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners. Last night’s game in Miami was the first outside Japan. The rest of the 30 major league teams begin play today or tomorrow.

{"headline": "Whoever Wins Los Angeles Higher Debt Price Signaled: Muni Credit", "article": "Los Angeles bonds are beating the $3.7 trillion municipal market even as leading mayoral candidates oppose a measure to raise the sales tax while also vowing to eliminate a $450 million-a-year business levy. As residents of the second-most populous U.S. city vote today on a successor to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , they also face a ballot measure to boost the sales tax to 9.5 percent from 9 percent. That would tie Los Angeles with Chicago for the highest rate among the 10 largest American cities. Less than two months ago, Los Angeles got its first credit upgrade in more than 20 years from Moody’s Investors Service, which cited property-tax growth. Investors such as Daniel Genter at RNC Genter Capital Management in Los Angeles say the election outcome won’t be enough to derail the city’s debt. Los Angeles is benefiting from demand for California munis after tax increases championed by Governor Jerry Brown. “California paper is pretty attractive and we don’t see this election changing that right away,” said Genter, who manages about $2 billion of munis, including Los Angeles bonds. Mayor’s Endorsement Villaraigosa, a 60-year-old Democrat who cannot run again because of term limits , has endorsed the sales-tax increase. The higher tax would yield from $208 million to $215 million a year, according to an estimate from City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana , comparable with the deficits he projected for each of the next three years. Yet city Controller Wendy Greuel and Councilman Eric Garcetti, who have raised the most money in the race, have spoken against the higher sales tax and also advocated for scrapping the tax on business receipts. At $450 million a year it’s the fourth-largest revenue source. They said at a Feb. 7 debate that phasing out the business tax would encourage companies to move to and grow in Los Angeles, lifting property and other taxes. Moody’s upgraded the city of 3.8 million to Aa2 in January, the third-highest level, citing growth in property levies, its largest revenue source. Standard & Poor’s rates Los Angeles AA-, its fourth-highest mark. Sussan Corson, a director in public finance at S&P, said by telephone that passage of the sales-tax measure could accelerate progress in reducing recurring budget deficits. Rising Demand Investor demand for L.A. debt has risen. The difference in the yield spread between city general obligations maturing in September 2020 and top-rated debt was about 0.4 percentage point last month, according to Bloomberg Valuation pricing. That gap was down from an average of about 0.6 percentage point for most of last year. If voters reject the tax boost, Los Angeles would have to reduce its 10,000-officer police force by as much as 500, Villaraigosa said Feb. 11. At a press conference backing the tax measure, Villaraigosa declined to respond to mayoral candidates’ claims that the city could maintain or even expand its police force without higher taxes. “When you’ve made the kinds of cuts we’ve made, you have to look for new revenue,” said the mayor. Los Angeles has already faced $1.6 billion in deficits over the past four years. The city has reduced its workforce by 5,300 positions, or more than 14 percent, since 2007, according to Santana’s February report. Cost Analysis Scrapping the business tax would equate to losing more than 40 swimming programs, firing more than 2,200 police officers or firefighters, or neglecting to fill more than 21 million potential potholes, according to figures compiled by Santana in a September presentation. For Marilyn Cohen , president of Envision Capital Management Inc., the candidates’ pledges to reduce taxes without affecting city services add to concern that the city is failing to address its fiscal challenges. The firm has no Los Angeles debt among its $325 million of holdings. “They’ve dug such a hole that they’re going to have to show me that they’re being fiscally prudent,” said Cohen, who’s based in Los Angeles. Cohen said none of the leading candidates has offered a sufficient proposal to curb the city’s pension liabilities or other employee benefit costs. Pension Bill Los Angeles’ pension contributions are projected to reach $999 million this year, more than double the level for the year ended June 30, 2006, according to a report by Santana. The city has a $7.2 billion general fund. In October, the City Council voted to raise the retirement age for non-safety employees to 65 from 55 and limit pension payments to 75 percent of final salary. In the February debate, City Councilwoman Jan Perry and lawyer Kevin James , the only Republican in the race, stopped short of calling for eliminating the business tax. Perry said the city would need to find an alternative revenue source. James suggested a flat fee rather than a tax on business income. In a USC Price/Los Angeles Times poll of 500 likely voters taken Feb. 24-27, Garcetti led with 27 percent, Greuel had 25 percent, James had 15 percent and Perry 14 percent. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two finishers advance to a runoff May 21. The survey, with a 4.4 percentage point margin of error, found 53 percent support the tax boost, with 41 percent opposing it and 6 percent undecided. Candidates’ Approach Austin Beutner, a co-founder of New York investment bank Evercore Partners Inc. and former Los Angeles deputy mayor, moderated the February debate. In an interview March 1, he said none of the candidates has a realistic approach to the city’s budget dilemma. “I was singularly unsuccessful in drawing out of any of the candidates anything other than the notion that ‘We’ll grow the pie,’” Beutner said. “They haven’t identified where new revenue would come from, they’ve sworn off new taxes, and they’re not making any specific proposals regarding employee compensation and benefits.” Beutner said investors probably won’t punish Los Angeles for the vagueness of its prospective leaders’ proposals or even for the possible failure of the sales-tax increase. That’s because most debt is issued by the city’s self- funding airport and port authorities and its public water and power utility, which rely on user fees rather than taxes, he said. Also, most debt pledged against the city general fund is short-term revenue anticipation notes rather than general obligations, he said. In trading yesterday, yields on tax-exempt benchmark debt due in 30 years were little changed at about 2.98 percent, close to the highest since September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

{"headline": "Indonesian Rupiah Weakens on European Downgrades; Bonds Advance", "article": "Indonesia ’s rupiah fell after Moody’s Investors Service warned that the U.K. and France may lose their top credit ratings after downgrading six European nations including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Bonds gained. The rupiah extended this month’s loss to 0.6 percent as overseas investors sold $147 million more local stocks than they bought, paring net purchases this year to $122 million, exchange data show. Moody’s revised its outlook on the U.K. and France’s ratings to “negative” yesterday. “The near-term volatility is the result of the situation in Europe ,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “Going forward, it looks like there will be strong support from the resilient domestic market” because the economy remains strong, he said. The rupiah dropped 0.6 percent to 9,056 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predict the currency will decline a further 0.5 percent to 9,100 by the end of this quarter. Southeast Asia ’s largest economy grew 6.5 percent last year in the biggest gain since before the Asian financial crisis. Indonesia will expand 6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the central bank forecast on Feb. 9. The government will probably lower its 2012 economic expansion target from 6.7 percent as Europe’s debt crisis clouds global economic prospects, Vice Finance Minister Anny Ratnawati said today in Jakarta. She didn’t say what the new target will be. The yield on the 7 percent bonds due May 2022 declined six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.11 percent, according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.

{"headline": "Hungary Loan Plans Among Reasons for OTP Share Sale, Csanyi Says", "article": "OTP Bank Nyrt. Chief Executive Officer Sandor Csanyi said a government proposal to help foreign-currency borrowers, which may hurt banks, prompted him to speed up plans to sell most of his company shares. Csanyi, the head of Hungary ’s largest bank, raised 10.7 billion forint ($48 million) by selling 2.35 million shares in two days last week. The share price lost as much as 17 percent, stoking concern the government’s plan may put earnings at risk. Csanyi said he will use the sale proceeds to finance investments in his agricultural and food business. Prime Minister Viktor Orban , who faces elections next year, wants to help borrowers saddled with more than $16 billion in mostly Swiss franc-denominated mortgages, whose payments soared as the forint dropped during the global credit crisis. Banks holding the mortgages would carry some of the exchange losses, according to government proposals the cabinet is debating today, Nepszabadsag newspaper reported. “News that the government was considering the foreign-currency debt problem had an impact as I authorized the sale at a lower share price,” Csanyi said at a press conference in Budapest today. “I would’ve sold these shares anyway, it was in my plans for this year.” The government wants to “phase out” foreign-currency home mortgages and will consider the time it takes and the burden that can be imposed as it works on a solution, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told state news service MTI today. Family Holdings “I personally and my family members also hold OTP Opus bonds, so there’s no question that I have any doubts on whether OTP is a good investment,” Csanyi said. The 60-year-old executive rejected a report in daily Magyar Nemzet that he sold shares because he planned to retire for health reasons. “I have entirely recovered” from a February heart surgery, “my physical condition is better than before the operation,” he said. OTP shares plunged in the three days through July 19 as Csanyi sold all but 10,000 of his personal holding of the stock. It gained 4.6 percent to 4,442 forint by 2:12 p.m. in Budapest today. OTP “can survive” any sort of government program to help foreign-currency borrowers, Csanyi said, adding that a solution similar to the early repayment of such loans in 2011 would put planned domestic acquisitions on hold. OTP dropped 36 percent and the forint weakened 12 percent in 2011, when the government forced banks to take losses by allowing borrowers to repay foreign-currency loans early at below-market rates. “I can only hope the government will consult with banks on the foreign-currency loan plan,” which must have burden sharing, Csanyi said.

{"headline": "Yen Reaches Strongest Versus Dollar Since Intervention as U.S. Data Slows", "article": "The yen reached the strongest level versus the dollar since the Bank of Japan intervened to weaken the currency as a report showed lower-than-forecast U.S. consumer confidence, boosting demand for refuge assets. The dollar reached a five-month low against the euro as consumer sentiment dropped, fueling speculation the Federal Reserve will resume quantitative easing, or the large-scale purchase of debt, to bolster the economy. The Bank of Japan sold yen Sept. 15 to stem an 11 percent year-to-date surge in the currency that was hampering an export-led economic recovery. The Swiss franc strengthened to a record level against the dollar for the second time in five days. “We’re in that period where the other safe havens, the yen and the franc, will gain against the U.S. dollar,” said Brian Kim , a currency strategist at UBS AG, said by phone from Stamford, Connecticut. “People are bracing themselves for whatever level of easing the Fed may come up with if the recovery continues to be soft.” The yen strengthened 0.4 percent to 83.94 yen per dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in New York, from 84.29. It reached 83.69, the highest level since Sept. 15, when it also touched a 15-year low of 82.88. The euro bought 114 yen, compared with 113.41 yen, after touching 112.67 yen. The dollar fell 0.9 percent to $1.3581 per euro, the weakest since April 15, compared with $1.3455 yesterday. Currency War The Ministry of Finance in Tokyo will report on Sept. 30 the amount of yen the central bank sold from Aug. 28 through Sept. 28 to curb the appreciation of the currency. Demand for the yen has been tempered by speculation Japan will sell its currency again. Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega said yesterday that a “currency war” has begun, with nations seeking to lower the value of their currencies to bolster exports. Leaders of Group of 20 nations will seek to ease tensions about exchange rates by the end of their November summit, a South Korean official said. “Policy makers are talking over the currency issue and thus I expect they will be able to find a compromise at the Seoul summit,” Sakong Il, chairman of the South Korea’s presidential committee for the summit, told reporters in Seoul today. Confidence among U.S. consumers fell in September to the lowest level in seven months as Americans became more pessimistic about the labor market. The Conference Board’s confidence index declined to 48.5, lower than forecast, from 53.2 the prior month. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decline to 52.1. U.S. Data “This number will be more of a negative than a positive for the dollar,” said Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “Given the market discussion and focus on the nature and prospects of quantitative easing, that theme that’s going to be the most prevalent.” The yen will trade between 83.50 and 84 per dollar because of the “of the market’s attention and focus and nervousness about possible Bank of Japan action,” Bennenbroek said. “Japan should change its structure to raise living standards using the strong yen,” by encouraging overseas mergers and acquisitions and purchasing mining rights for natural resources, Kazuo Mizuno , deputy director-general of economic assessment at the Cabinet Office, said in an interview in Tokyo today. “Japan had to put out the fire” by selling the yen, he said. U.S. policies indicate the currency trend won’t be reversed soon so “Japan should expect the dollar to remain weak in the mid-term,” he said. Export Gains Japan’s exports increased 15.8 percent from a year earlier in August, the slowest growth since December, the Finance Ministry said in Tokyo yesterday. The Swiss franc gained 0.9 percent against the dollar to 97.60 centimes, from 98.53 yesterday. It touched a record 97.38. Investors traditionally buy the franc during times of economic turmoil because of the perceived stability of the Swiss economy and current account surplus, and offload the currency when they want to take on more risk. The dollar has depreciated 11 percent versus the euro this quarter in the worst performance among the European currency’s 16 major counterparts. The greenback has pared this year’s advance to 5.1 percent. “We are becoming increasingly convinced that euro-dollar can perform well in this environment where the worst point of the European bond markets crisis is behind us and the policy mix in the U.S. is increasingly having a negative impact on the dollar,” Tom Fitzpatrick and Shyam Devani , technical analysts for Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note to clients. Pound Down The pound plummeted against the euro to the weakest since May after Bank of England policy maker Adam Posen said the central bank should restart its asset-purchase program to prevent persistent slow economic growth. “There remains a significant gap between what the economy could be producing at full employment and it currently produces,” he said in a speech today in Hull, England, today. “Monetary policy should continue to be aggressive about promoting recovery, and, subject to further debate, I think further easing should be undertaken.” The pound fell 1.2 percent to 85.98 pence per euro, the weakest since May 24 when it touched 86.97.

{"headline": "FDIC to Issue Securities Backed by $500 Million of Residential Mortgages", "article": "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to issue securities backed by about $500 million of home mortgages acquired from failed banks, leaning again on guarantees to help sell the debt.  The FDIC will back about 85 percent of bonds created for the offering and it may not sell the deal’s junior-ranked notes, which will lose principal first amid any defaults on the underlying loans, David Barr , an agency spokesman, said.  “The decision hasn’t been made yet,” he said today in a telephone interview. “We may sell all or a portion of the certificates at some point in the future,”  The FDIC, which has closed more than 250 banks since 2008, began raising cash in the bond market for the first time since the early 1990s in March. The Washington-based agency that month sold $3.8 billion of guaranteed notes in three deals.  As of May 31, the agency held about $32 billion of assets from failed banks excluding about $7.9 billion of interests in limited liability companies that it has also been creating to help offload its holdings, Barr said.  Two of the FDIC’s March bond sales were backed by its loans to such companies, while the other transaction was a repackaging of existing mortgage bonds.  Barr declined to discuss the timing of the latest sale. RBS Securities Inc. is underwriting the transaction.  The FDIC-backed debt is probably most comparable to atypical types of so-called agency mortgage bonds carrying government-backed guarantees, such as Washington-based Fannie Mae’s securities tied to multifamily mortgages, said David Land , a money manager at St. Paul, Minnesota-based Advantus Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $18 billion.  An investor may want to accept similar yields as found with those types of securities, “depending on how much you value liquidity,” Land said in a telephone interview.

{"headline": "Iran’s Ahmadinejad Says Talks Will Progress After U.S. Election", "article": "Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said talks over his country’s development of enriched uranium will be more productive after the U.S. election and expressed optimism the two sides will “be able to take some steps forward.” “We have seen during many years that as we approach the United States presidential election, no important decisions are made,” Ahmadinejad said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” program. “Following the election, certainly the atmosphere will be much more stable, and important decisions can be made and announced.” Ahmadinejad, who is completing his second and last term as president, said meetings over Iran ’s nuclear program with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany , will result in “a very important decision” following the U.S. November election. Iran contends its nuclear facilities are for peaceful civilian purposes. “We have set forth proposals, we are holding dialogue,” he said in the CNN interview, according to a transcript of the program scheduled to air today. “We do hope to be able to take some steps forward.” U.S. President Barack Obama , in Sept. 25 speech before the General Assembly, said that time “is not unlimited” to reach a diplomatic resolution and vowed that the U.S. “will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” ‘Hell to Pay’ Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrat Obama’s efforts to work with U.S. allies and impose strict sanctions on Iran is the correct policy. In an interview with Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with Al Hunt ,” Lugar said that there “will be hell to pay” if those calling for war with Iran are successful. “The implications for the Israeli people here are very severe,” said Luger, 80, who is leaving the Senate after 36 years following his defeat in a primary in May. “The idea of moving with our allies, as many as we can find, on effective sanctions on the country has been the right move.” Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Obama’s position, saying the president hasn’t been tough enough and that military action shouldn’t be ruled out. Romney said he would seek an international indictment of Ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide and would treat Iran’s diplomats “like the pariah they are.” Red Lines Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, using a cartoon drawing of a bomb, told the UN Sept. 27 that the international community should impose “red lines” on Iran’s program to prevent the country from building nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad said he wasn’t concerned that action by Israel would alter Iranian policies. He likened any attacks to those by terrorists who explode bombs or assassinate officials. “Will the country be destroyed? No,” Ahmadinejad said. “We see the Zionist regime at the same level of the bombers and criminals and the terrorists. Even if they do something, hypothetically, it will not affect us fundamentally.” Ahmadinejad denied reports that the Iranian economy is faltering and said the sanctions haven’t hurt foreign trade. “Many of the European companies are currently, as we speak, conducting trade with us,” he said. “Some of them do it in hiding. They do secretly, but they do conduct that trade. You hear some news and you believe that Iran’s economy is now in chaos. It is not so.” Iran’s Economy Foreign investment in Iran jumped 83 percent to $6.8 billion in the first half of the current Iranian year, which began on March 20, the Tehran Times reported Sept. 27, citing Deputy Economy Minister Behrouz Alishiri. Iran’s Central Bank on Sept. 5 said the country’s inflation rate was 23.5 percent in the month that ended Aug. 20. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani was quoted by Shargh newspaper Sept. 26 as saying it was actually 29 percent. Iran‘s currency, the rial, hit a record low against the U.S. dollar yesterday in the country‘s capital, Tehran, where the street traders were selling dollars at 28,100 rials, the state-Run Mehr news agency reported. On Syria , Ahmadinejad again refused to call on President Bashar al-Assad to step down. He said a group whose members include representatives from Egypt , Turkey , Iran and Saudi Arabia could help negotiate a peace, including setting up a national election. Syrian troops are battling with rebels in the commercial hub of Aleppo, the country’s largest city. International efforts to end the 18-month conflict have failed to stop the violence as rebels continue the fight to overthrow Assad that began March of last year. The conflict has killed 30,000 people, according to estimates by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group.

{"headline": "Weight-Loss Surgery Cuts Risks for Severely Obese, Heart Association Says", "article": "Severely obese people benefit from weight-loss surgery, the American Heart Association said after researchers from the U.S. and Canada assessed the heart risks of bariatric procedures. Operations such as gastric bypass and gastric banding may lead to weight loss and improvements in diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure, and those benefits may outweigh the hazards, the Dallas-based heart group said in a paper today in the journal Circulation. Almost 34 percent of Americans are obese, a number that has doubled in the past 30 years, and more than 5 percent are considered extremely obese, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overweight or obese people have a greater risk of diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. Efforts with diet, exercise and drugs have been “disappointing,” so doctors need to look at surgical options , said Paul Poirier , lead author of the report. “At the moment, bariatric surgery should be reserved for patients who can undergo surgery safely, have severe obesity and have failed attempts at medical therapy,” Poirier, director of the cardiac prevention and rehabilitation program at Quebec Heart & Lung Institute at Laval University Hospital in Quebec City , said in a statement. Further Research The report isn’t an “across-the-board” endorsement, Poirier said. More studies are needed on the weight-loss procedures in adults and children, he said. About 220,000 people in the U.S. had weight-loss surgery in 2009, according to the most recent figures from the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery, a doctors’ organization based in Gainesville, Florida. The procedures cost on average of $14,000 to $26,000, the group said on its website. Allergan Inc., based in Irvine, California , won U.S. clearance in February to broaden marketing of its Lap-Band weight-loss device. The Food and Drug Administration now will let the company target people with a body mass index of at least 30 and at least one obesity-related condition. Lap-Band competes with Realize, a band sold by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , of New Brunswick , New Jersey. Body mass index , or BMI, is a measure of weight and height, with a 5-foot, 4-inch (160-centimer) woman weighing 175 pounds (80 kilograms) having a BMI of 30. BMI of 30 or more is considered obese, while a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health , based in Bethesda, Maryland. A BMI of 40 and more is considered extremely obese. ‘Treatment of Choice’ “The AHA hasn’t addressed this issue in such a direct manner previously, but has included bariatric surgery as an option for severely obese patients in other documents,” Robert Eckel, past president of the group and a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, in Aurora, Colorado, said in an e-mail on March 11. For people who have a BMI of 40 and higher, surgery is the “treatment of choice,” Eckel said. The heart group’s researchers found that surgery “provides the greatest sustainable weight loss.” The surgeries also reversed diabetes and improved high blood pressure, sleep apnea and liver disease, according to the heart group. A review of eight studies showed that those who underwent weight-loss surgeries had a lower risk of dying compared with those who didn’t have the procedures, according to the paper. One study showed the risk of dying was 9 percent in those who had surgery compared with 28 percent in those who didn’t. Allergan’s Applause “The medical literature has found that diet and exercise alone simply does not work for everyone who is obese and that without effective treatment the obese will likely remain obese, which is why we applaud the American Heart Association for recognizing that weight-loss surgery needs to be part of the obesity treatment continuum,” Cathy Taylor, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said an e-mail on March 11. In gastric bypass, doctors create a small pouch about the size of a walnut at the top of the stomach and connect it to a passage that bypasses the rest of the stomach and part of the small intestine. That arrangement limits the body’s ability to absorb calories. Gastric bypass accounts for than 80 percent of weight-loss procedures, according to the heart association. In laparoscopic gastric banding , a band is placed around the upper end of the stomach, creating a pouch that narrows the passage into the rest of the stomach, causing a patient to feel fuller. The heart group’s statement adds to growing awareness of the weight-loss surgery, said Bruce Wolfe , president of the bariatric surgery society, in a telephone interview on March 11. Heart doctors are “recognizing it as an important tool in the battle against obesity and cardiovascular risk,” said Wolfe, a professor of surgery at Oregon Health & Science University , in Portland.

{"headline": "South African World Cup May Be Iciest in Decades; Fans Seek Hats, Gloves", "article": "South Africa, which counts sun- soaked beach holidays among its tourist attractions, has been hit by icy weather that threatens to make the Soccer World Cup the coldest in decades.  Temperatures this week have dropped to as low as minus five degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit) in Johannesburg, prompting many of the more than 54,000 fans at the Ellis Park night-time clash between North Korea and Brazil to don gloves, woolen hats and overcoats. This was as much as eight degrees below the 40-year average, according to Derek Van Dam, chief meteorologist at Etv, a privately owned television station.  “We have ended up doing a lot more indoor activities” than we expected,” said Rajeev Nath, a 31-year-old New Yorker who is in South Africa for the tournament. “We haven’t had enough warm clothes so have been buying. We’ll continue to just layer up.”  The first World Cup to take place in Africa is also the first to be held in winter since Argentina hosted and won the tournament in 1978. Rain has lashed game venues in Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and snow has fallen fall across the country’s mountain ranges.  Ghana’s training session yesterday was delayed because of frozen pitches at their training base north of Rustenburg, according to the South African Press Association. Heavy rain in Port Elizabeth this week meant that Germany and Serbia couldn’t train on the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium pitch on eve of their match today.  Reduced Rail Service  The rapid rail line between Johannesburg’s main airport and business district is operating at half the normal speed as a precautionary measure because of the cold. Trips from Sandton to O.R. Tambo airport are now leaving every half an hour and taking 30 minutes, according to the Gautrain website.  Today Johannesburg is expected to have a maximum of 11 degrees celsius and a minimum of -1. By contrast Berlin in Germany, where the last World Cup took place in 2006, has a forecast maximum of 20 degrees and a minimum of 5 degrees. Seoul in South Korea, which co-hosted the 2002 event, has a maximum of 32 degrees while Buenos Aires in Argentina has a maximum of 13 degrees and a minimum of 12 degrees.  No T-Shirts  A fan park at Mary Fitzgerald square in central Johannesburg attracted few fans on the night of June 16 when the home team, South Africa, slashed their chances of progressing in the tournament by losing 3-0 to Uruguay in Pretoria.  “Its much colder than we expected,” Irena Cegla, a 43- year-old tourist from Venezuela, said in an interview. “I thought we may wear T-Shirts during the day but it’s much too cold.”  In addition to the Germany versus Serbia match, Slovenia today plays the U.S. at Ellis Park in Johannesburg while England plays Algeria in Cape Town.

{"headline": "No $10 Million Check Needed for Argentine Vineyards", "article": "At the southern end of Argentina ’s Uco Valley in the foothills of the Andes, Jose Manuel Ortega Gil-Fournier is helping make investors’ dreams of producing wine from their own vineyards come true. An investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Banco Santander SA (SAN) before leaving the world of finance in 2006, Ortega is selling 140 hectares of land planted with malbec and other varietals for $150,000 per hectare. More importantly, he promises to do all the work in caring for them. Ortega is counting on the allure of vines that produced his 93-point Alfa Crux Blend (2003) and 94-point O. Fournier Syrah (2002) to distinguish him from other sellers of personal lots in Mendoza province, the hub of the country’s wine industry. “The Uco Valley is producing not just the best wines in Argentina but some of the best in the world,” said Daniel Pita, a hedge fund lawyer from Sao Paulo who bought into the Ortega project without ever having visited Mendoza. “If you look at other regions that are famous for good wine, like Bordeaux and Napa, you can’t even think about investing there.” Argentina’s personal vineyard market is expanding after pioneers at Vines of Mendoza started marketing parcels to international investors in 2006. They have since sold 106 plots that produce 240 unique wines. Ortega’s program is the first by an established Argentine winery to admit “partners,” as he refers to clients who buy property surrounding his namesake bodega 90 minutes south of Mendoza city, the provincial capital. Colonial History “We’re inviting 85 investors, wine lovers, to share the experience of being a winery owner without having to write a $10 million check,” Ortega, 44, said in an interview at his restaurant, Urban, which looks out toward the snowcapped Andes. “We’re socializing the pleasures of owning a vineyard and making wine.” While Mendoza’s wine industry dates back to the Spanish colonial period, the parched, rock-strewn Uco Valley, 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level , was little developed a decade ago. Since then, it has attracted the world’s top vintners. Not far from Ortega’s O. Fournier winery, French oenologist Michel Rolland joined winemakers Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault in creating Clos de los Siete, a group of seven bodegas whose Monteviejo and Lindaflor blends are standouts. Argentine Risks Putting money into Argentina, whether you’re talking land, companies or bonds, may seem risky given its history of defaults, devaluations and confiscations. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner surprised investors in April when she seized YPF SA, the country’s biggest oil company, from Spain ’s Repsol YPF SA. (REP) In December, Congress passed a law blocking foreigners from owning large swaths of rural land. “It is of concern but I don’t really believe that the nationalization trend is going to be widespread,” said Tom Biery, a co-founder of Houston-based oil and gas producer Quail Creek Companies, who’s looking forward to serving his own Uco Valley wine at parties in a few years. “And while our investment isn’t insignificant, it isn’t huge either.” Ortega had planned to start his private vineyard project in 2008 but delayed it when the U.S. real estate collapse and the fall of Lehman Brothers helped spark a global economic slowdown. “We put it on hold for a while and late last year decided that the U.S. economy was getting better, Asia was getting better and Brazil was booming,” he said. “We thought those would be three major markets to point toward.” Bottle Design As well as the land, purchasers get their vines planted and maintained for three years. They can also work with Ortega’s staff to design bottle labels, blend their own wines and ship them abroad. Ortega estimates annual maintenance costs after the first three years will average about $4,000, which can be offset by selling grapes to the winery or marketing the wines. About 10 vineyard owners will be able to build residences on their plots, which could be rented out to a luxury hotel Ortega plans to break ground on later this year. Once you’ve taken your seat at Urban, the sale is an easy one. The towering glass-walled restaurant leaves you looking past vines heavy with plump malbec clusters to the jagged peaks of the Andes. Urban’s cuisine is overseen by Ortega’s wife, Nadia, whose eponymous restaurant near Mendoza city was voted Argentina’s best last year by the country’s National Culinary Academy. Lunch Menu At Urban, my wife and I settle into a four-course lunch with wine pairings. Our repast begins with a cream of parmesan and chardonnay-caramelized onions, transitions to a pork loin over a mash of potato and orange with soy sauce and ends with an olive oil sorbet. With accompanying wines, the total is 260 pesos ($58) each, a quarter of the cost of the tasting menu at Napa Valley ’s Auberge du Soleil. Michael Evans , co-founder of Vines of Mendoza, says the combination of high-quality wines and affordability is the hook that keeps drawing investors to the country and the concept of private vineyards. “The more people come down and see that they can make wine in Argentina and be exposed to the magic of this place, the better for all of us,” Evans said.

{"headline": "New U.S. Ambassador Sparks Emotional Debate in China: Adam Minter", "article": "Is Gary Locke , the first ethnically Chinese U.S. ambassador to China, a traitor to his Chinese heritage? China’s editorialists, bloggers and microbloggers have debated this question in various forms, and within various forums, since President Barack Obama  nominated Locke in March 2011. But the discussion has reached a new intensity with Locke’s recent arrival in Beijing , producing a remarkable degree of public introspection on attitudes toward the Chinese race, and Chinese self-identity. Locke is a third-generation American of Chinese heritage, but in the eyes of many Chinese, he is a returning son. The Chinese media and public follow so-called “overseas Chinese” -- politicians like Locke, intellectuals like Amy Chua , artists like architect I.M. Pei and musicians like Yo Yo Ma -- with passion. The Chinese media, both proud and insecure, use their accomplishments as benchmarks for measuring China ’s standing in the world. The successes of these overseas Chinese are claimed as Chinese successes. In October 1997, the Chinese Communist Party granted Locke, who was then the newly-elected governor of Washington State, a private audience with then-president Jiang Zemin. This was a rare and unusual honor for a U.S. governor from a minor (from the Chinese perspective) state. With his new position as the U.S. ambassador to China, many Chinese hope (and believe) that this returning son will remember his origins when considering U.S. interests against competing Chinese ones. The nationalist, state-owned Global Times newspaper repeated a commonly held sentiment in China today: “Locke's Chinese origins might gain him some advantages in understanding China's public opinion, which is not necessarily always reserved and mild.” In an unsigned editorial in Southern Metropolis Daily, the editors agreed with the Global Times: “ Gary Locke has a natural cultural advantage in the problem of sharing values between China and the U.S. The two countries could take this opportunity.” But equally common is a harsh counterpoint to this optimistic point-of-view: Locke is an (American) wolf in (Chinese) sheep’s clothing who will overcompensate for his ethnic background by coming down harder on China than, perhaps, even a Caucasian U.S. ambassador. And, because of his Chinese face, he can accomplish his nefarious goals more efficiently. The prestigious, highly influential and government-owned Guangming Daily wrote : China has 55 officially-recognized minority ethnicities , but 92 percent of the Chinese public claims a Han Chinese background. Such homogenized racial identity isn’t unusual in East Asia ; Korea and Japan are even less diversified. What is unusual in China, however, is the degree to which majority racial attitudes are discussed and dissected in private homes and, when the occasion arises, in the Chinese media. Race relations in American politics often provide inspiration for such talk. For instance, President Obama’s candidacy and election stirred much public soul-searching on whether or not a Chinese minority could ever ascend to the top of the Chinese Communist Party. (The most common answer: \"No.\") But Locke’s new position as U.S. ambassador to China strikes a deeper chord with the Chinese than Obama's presidency. It has forced a tradition-bound East Asian society to question the global reach of its homogenized self-image. On August 16, Wu Xianghong, a business columnist with the Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolitan Daily -- China’s most important independent newspaper -- published a remarkable essay. In it, Wu identified a peculiar type of Chinese racism: This kind of racialist thinking influences Chinese perceptions of Locke. For example, a popular pejorative is to refer to a Chinese person who has adopted Western values as a \"banana\": white on the inside and yellow on the outside. Wu suggested that some media representatives have recently contended that: “he who is a 'banana man' will be even more anti-China than a full blooded American.” Wu further explained that some Chinese, “expect Gary Locke to be more familiar with Chinese people and to be better than any other American ambassador.” Of this, he expresses contempt: The racialist approach to Locke is not pervasive in China. On the popular microblogs, some netizens say that Locke is first and foremost an American. A user of the Sina Weibo microblog, Nico ever , tweeted: Still, for all of the talk about Locke's affinities and opportunities, he will likely remain a charged figure for the Chinese to measure themselves against. Late last week, a Chinese-American businessman photographed Locke wearing a backpack while buying his own coffee at a Starbucks in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Chinese microbloggers, bloggers and editorialists jumped at the chance to contrast Locke’s no-frills independence while traveling with the grandiose entourages that accompany even the lowliest Chinese officials. Liu Runhua, director of the Shenzhen Civil Affairs Bureau, tweeted on Sina Weibo: However, not every commentator on the photo was as admiring. Some suggested that Locke’s entourage-free travel reflected the U.S. government’s financial problems. And, perhaps more damaging, some suggested that Locke’s no-frills persona is fake, and even calculated. “The performance of Gary Locke is both a result of his personal quality and a type of PR,” wrote Dou Hanzhang, a former journalist with the state-owned Xinhua news service on Sina Weibo. Soon though, the discussion will likely return from the semiotics of Locke's backpack to the larger question of Chinese identity and achievement. An Puruo (the pen name of Walter Huang, a well-known U.S.-based Chinese investor and writer) used the story of Locke’s immigrant grandparents in America to reflect upon the difficulties of China's migrant workers today -- especially their struggles to provide their children with a strong education. In Shanghai , for example, migrant children must attend specially designated migrant schools; they do not have access to the city’s superior, resident-only educational system. An’s reflections are poignant, and pointed: If the discussion over Locke’s American ambassadorship is any indication, China’s netizens are thinking about him as a symbol of equality obtained, and equality denied. His Chinese race certainly plays a role in generating this attention, but it is quickly yielding far more interesting narratives. In contemporary China, at least, that qualifies as \"post-racial.\"  (Adam Minter is the Shanghai correspondent for the World View blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)

{"headline": "Russia Scraps Bond Auction as Investors Demand Higher Yields", "article": "Russia scrapped an auction of bonds for the first time since May after investors demanded higher yields than the government offered. The Finance Ministry had planned to sell 30 billion rubles ($956 million) of notes due in February 2019 at a yield of 7.12 percent to 7.17 percent. The yield on Russia’s seven-year OFZ notes jumped four basis points to 7.27 percent by 2:01 p.m. in Moscow, the highest in a week, after a six basis-point increase yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bond yields climbed and the ruble weakened after Urals crude dropped 1.7 percent yesterday, its sixth day of declines. Russia, the world’s largest energy exporter, relies on oil and gas for 50 percent of its budget revenue. The OFZ’s yield has tumbled 140 basis points since June to a record-low 7.17 percent on Oct. 22. “The rally in OFZs is over,” Egor Fedorov, a credit analyst at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said by telephone after the government’s statement today. “Yields started rising very tangibly yesterday as a reaction to negative global factors. Local investors want to take profit, as foreign ones will be more cautious.” Russia scrapped all its auctions in May as Urals dropped 15 percent, its biggest monthly decline for two years. Today’s auction was shelved because the bids “exceeded the highest end of yield guidance,” the Finance Ministry said in a website statement. Emerging-market stocks declined today as concern Europe ’s economic crisis is deepening pared investor appetite for riskier assets. German business confidence unexpectedly fell to the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years and a report showed euro-area services and manufacturing contracted more than economists estimated. Europe is Russia’s biggest trading partner. “You can get better yields on the secondary market,” Fedorov said.

Hites, the country’s sixth-largest retailer by market value, fell 3.2 percent to 449.82 pesos at the close of trading in Santiago, the lowest since Jan. 11. The benchmark Ipsa index advanced 0.7 percent. The stock has fallen 19 percent since April 12 after the country’s consumer rights agency, known as Sernac, said it would file a class-action lawsuit against the retailer for overcharging its credit card customers. Scrapping the disputed charges could reduce revenue by as much as 20 billion pesos ($42.4 million) and lower its estimated profit for this year by 37 percent to 8.84 billion pesos, BCI said in an e-mailed report today. “Potential risks and a reduction in earnings generation capacity could also lead to lower access to funding for Hites,” BCI analysts including Veronica Perez wrote. Sernac said in a statement that Hites had wording in its credit card contracts allowing the company to charge special commissions when their cards were used to buy items in installments. The agreements also allowed Hites to charge management commissions twice, according to Sernac. An official at Hites’s external public relations firm said the retailer wouldn’t comment. The company said in an April 12 statement that it hadn’t been officially notified of the lawsuit and its credit agreements are in line with regulations. Hites’s credit card business accounted for 71 percent of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year, according to calculations done by Bloomberg based on the company’s most recent annual filing to Chile ’s securities regulator.

{"headline": "Sri Lanka's Postwar Boom Not Enough to Lure Investors Wary of Corruption", "article": "With a postcard view of white sand and fishermen drawing in nets from the morning catch, the Chaaya Blu Hotel could be mistaken for a resort in Bali or Phuket. In fact it’s in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, a country that 18 months ago saw the bloodiest battles of a three-decade civil war. “You went out every day not knowing what would happen,” said Richard Vokes , the country director for Asian Development Bank. Vokes used to don a flak jacket and helmet before traveling the heavily guarded 160 mile (257 kilometer) journey to the north-eastern city from the capital Colombo. Since government forces defeated the Tamil Tigers rebels in May 2009, the sandbags and checkpoints have mostly gone. In the capital, tourists stroll along the palm-fringed seaside promenade while locals fly kites in front of Colombo’s British colonial-era Galle Face Hotel. Living in Sri Lanka is now “a very pleasant experience,” said Vokes, whose bank had almost $2 billion in loans to Sri Lanka at the end of 2009. The Manila-based lender expects Sri Lanka’s economy to grow as much as 8 percent this year and next. Colombo’s stock market is the world’s second-best performer in 2010, after Mongolia, nearly doubling in value. A $1 billion sovereign bond issued in late September was 6.3 times oversubscribed. Visits from foreigners have risen 40 percent so far this year and may top 600,000 for 2010, according to the government, which aims to raise the number to 2.5 million by 2016, enticing travelers with white-sand beaches, leopard safaris and mountain temples. ‘Closed Shop’ “Sri Lanka has been a closed shop for 30 years,” said Joseph Michael Suresh Brito , chief executive officer of Colombo- based Aitken Spence Hotel Holdings , which is building a $40 million villa resort on the south coast with Bangkok-based Six Senses Resorts & Spas. “People will come with no fear.” Overseas investors remain concerned about corruption and red tape. Foreign direct investment fell to $208 million in the first six months, from $253 million in the same period of 2009. “There is a lot of renewed interest, but most of it is yet to be realized,” said Nick Nicolaou, Sri Lanka chief for London-based bank HSBC Holdings Plc. Tourism is one of the top three industries the government is counting on to reduce Sri Lanka’s reliance on the garment trade and low-end manufacturing. At least six hotels are in the works, including a $150 million resort by Hong Kong’s Shangri-La Asia Ltd. on a former military helipad on Colombo’s waterfront. Resort Refurbishing John Keells Hotels Plc. spent $40.5 million refurbishing the Chaaya Blu and is building a $20 million, 200-room resort in Beruwala, south of Colombo, said Krishan Balendra , president of corporate finance & group strategy at parent company John Keells Holdings Plc , Sri Lanka’s largest listed company. The government is promoting back-office and call-center operators, which already employ 60,000 and may bring in revenue of $350 million this year. By 2015 the government hopes business processing outsourcing, or BPO revenue will reach $1 billion. “The BPO potential is very high,” says Nicolaou at HSBC, which employs 1,800 people doing back-office work in Colombo. Agricultural exports, the third priority, grew 21 percent in the first eight months of the year, as farms that lay fallow during the conflict yield crops of rice, lentils, and beans. Investment Rules Sri Lanka is also aiming to boost investment flows in and out of the country, with the government yesterday loosening foreign-exchange controls. Sri Lankans will be allowed to invest in shares overseas and foreigners to invest in Sri Lankan corporate bonds. Authorities said they will reduce levies on tourism and construction companies. Overseas investors say the Board of Investment, a government agency that must approve foreign-funded projects, makes it difficult to do business in the country. “It’s fair to say we could improve our services,” said the board’s chairman, Jayampathi Bandaranayake, adding that the new focus on priority areas will simplify the approval process and offer more incentives to investors. Berlin-based watchdog Transparency International ranked Sri Lanka 91st out of 178 countries on Oct. 26 in terms of corruption, one spot behind India and 90 places below Singapore. While Bandaranayake of the BOI acknowledges that corruption is a problem, he said it’s no worse than in neighboring nations. In July the European Union rescinded Sri Lanka’s preferential trade access because of the country’s human rights record, particularly due to violence in the final weeks of the war that killed as many as 15,000 civilians. European Criticism Presidential spokesman Lucien Rajakarunanayake said human rights issues are “the highest priority” for parliament and called the EU conditions “unacceptable.” Some investors are concerned by the growing power of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. After Rajapaksa was elected to a second term in January and his party swept elections in April, parliament lifted the two-term limit for the presidency. Three of Rajapaksa’s brothers hold top government posts and his 24- year-old son is in parliament. “We haven’t seen evidence of it yet, but if the family’s power is used in the wrong way, then we have a big problem,” said Mark Mobius , who holds Sri Lankan stocks and bonds as part of the $33 billion he manages at Templeton Asset Management Ltd. One country quick to take advantage of the boom is China. A $455 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of China paid for a 300-megawatt power plant, Sri Lanka’s first coal-fired facility, at Norochcholai, a coastal village 120 kilometers north of Colombo. The plant is scheduled to open next year. Chinese Loans Another $560 million in loans from China will go toward new roads, including a 32-kilometer expressway from the capital to its airport. Chinese companies are building a $1.4 billion port in Hambantota and a $210 million airport in nearby Mattala. China Merchants Holdings International Co. , which has stakes in ports that move about a third of China’s container traffic, has teamed up with Aitken Spence to build a $450 million container terminal in Colombo port. “We aim to be among the 10 largest ports in the world by 2020, up from 27th last year,” said Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Priyath B. Wickrama in his office in a 19th century warehouse with exposed teak beams, overlooking a 6.8 kilometer breakwater being built by Seoul-based Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co.  Swiss cement maker Holcim Ltd. ’s Sri Lanka business is up 22 percent this year, thanks to construction of roads, bridges and buildings in war-ravaged areas like Trincomalee, said Stefan Huber, Sri Lanka CEO for the Jona-based company. “There are already a lot of hotel projects like Chaaya Blu,” he said. “It’s a great time to be here.” To contact the reporter on this story: Frederik Balfour in Hong Kong at  fbalfour@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "U.S. Mortgage Demand Rose From Two-Year Low on Falling Rates", "article": "The number of applications for U.S. mortgages rose last week, led by more refinancing as mortgage rates fell to the lowest level since the end of January. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of loan applications increased 13 percent in the week ended Feb. 18 after dropping the prior week to the lowest point since November 2008. The group’s refinancing measure jumped 18 percent and the purchase gauge rose 5.1 percent. “Refinancing is more sensitive to fluctuations in rates” than are purchases, Paul Dales , a senior economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in Toronto, said before the report. Still, he said he expected refinancing to “remain soft” with sales at “historically depressed levels for perhaps two or three years.” The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages dropped to 5 percent as turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa led investors to seek the safety of U.S. Treasury securities, which are benchmarks for some consumer loans, pulling down their yield. Still, mounting foreclosures, falling prices and 9 percent unemployment mean it will take time for demand to pick up. The 30-year rate fell from 5.12 percent the prior week. It reached 4.21 percent in October, the lowest since the group’s records began in 1990. At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each $100,000 of a loan would be $536.82, in line with the same week the prior year, when the rate was 5.04 percent. Rates Fall The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 4.28 percent from 4.34 percent. The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan rose to 65.7 percent from 64 percent the prior week. The housing market is struggling to gain traction after a homebuyers’ tax credit expired last year and as more properties fall into the foreclosure pipeline. Combined sales of existing and new homes in December were at a 5.61 million annual unit pace, down from a July 2005 record of 8.53 million. A report from the National Association of Realtors today may show existing home sales fell 1.1 percent to a 5.22 million annualized rate in January, according to economists’ estimates. Sales of previously owned homes last year totaled 4.91 million, the lowest level since 1997. Builder Losses Homebuilders are still posting losses. D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by stock-market value, on Jan. 27 reported a fiscal first-quarter loss that was wider than analysts projected. “I think 2011 will be a marginal, weak year in the homebuilding industry,” D.R. Horton Chief Executive Officer Donald Tomnitz said during a conference call the same day. “Given the weak macroeconomic conditions, high levels of existing homes for sale and tight mortgage availability, we remain cautious and realistic in our expectations.” The Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association ’s loan survey, compiled every week, covers about half of all U.S. retail residential mortgage originations.

{"headline": "Peru Prices Unexpectedly Fell Last Month as Food Costs Declined", "article": "Peruvian consumer prices unexpectedly fell last month as declining food prices offset increases in all other segments, the government reported. Consumer prices dropped 0.09 percent from January, the first decrease in three months, the government’s statistics agency said in an e-mailed statement today. The median forecast of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.18 percent increase. The annual inflation rate slowed to 2.45 percent from 2.87 percent in January, the agency said. Food and drink prices dropped 0.7 percent last month while electricity costs rose 2.3 percent. Gasoline rose 3 percent and private schooling fees climbed 2.5 percent, the agency said. Peru’s central bank may consider cutting borrowing costs if inflationary conditions allow, its research director Adrian Armas said Feb. 8 after policy makers kept their benchmark lending rate at 4.25 percent. Policy makers have held Peru ’s rate, the lowest in Latin America after Colombia, for 21 consecutive months. The central bank projects inflation of 2 percent this year, the mid-point of its target range. Peru’s economy expanded at the slowest pace in a year during the fourth quarter, rising 5.9 percent from the same period of 2011, as construction activity slowed and fishing contracted, the agency said Feb. 22.

{"headline": "UN CO2 Board Can Handle Jump in Credit Requests, Chairman Says", "article": "The world’s second-biggest carbon market is ready to handle a surge in requests for new credits this year by using regulators more effectively, the new chairman of the Clean Development Mechanism said. The program, where rich nations invest in emission-cutting projects in the developing world in exchange for tradable credits, will probably receive a 54 percent jump this year in requests for credits, according to a presentation published on the website of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. “It’s going to be a mixture” of deploying staffers more effectively and also drawing on temporary workers who already helped provide record supply of credits last month, Martin Hession, the newly appointed chairman of the board, said today in a phone interview from Bonn. The CDM’s executive board is open to suggestions on how to improve issuance of credits to renewable-energy projects in nations that already pay electricity subsidies to windfarms and hydro plants, Hession said. For instance, China may provide new data at an unspecified time about tariffs it pays in each region, potentially easing decisions about projects in that nation, he said. The board would seek to cut the time it takes to win approval for new systems that attract credits, known as methodologies , Hession said. Some methodologies have been waiting for more than a year for approval, he said. The board would seek to cut the time it takes for approval to less than a year, he said, declining to be more specific.

The company filed a prospectus with the market regulator for the sale of 33.6 million shares through a so-called book building process yesterday, Goutham said in a phone interview.

{"headline": "G-7 Stakes Increase as Global Policy Divide Raises Pressure, Macklem Says", "article": "Moves by countries from Japan to Brazil to weaken currencies and loosen monetary policies underscore the growing “stakes” for the global economy and the need for policy makers to correct imbalances together, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said. South Korea has moved in recent weeks to spur growth and weaken its currency. The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and India have indicated in the past two months they may seek to curb volatility, while the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are considering more asset purchases to boost private lending. The moves prompted Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega to warn Sept. 27 of a “currency war.” “These recent events are illustrative of the fact that the pressures for adjustment are building,” Macklem, 49, said in an interview in Montreal yesterday. “The stakes are getting higher.” Group of Seven ministers, chaired by Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty , will gather Oct. 8 at a dinner in Washington on the sidelines of an International Monetary Fund meeting. Flaherty said “some” finance ministers will meet tomorrow. There are no plans to issue a statement, he said. The meetings could produce a clash of views among countries that prefer flexible exchange rates and others, such as China, which are resisting calls to allow its currency to appreciate. Flaherty told reporters in Ottawa today that “we don’t want these kind of distortions in currency values or distortions in trading relationships.” ‘Considerable Posturing’ “What we want to see primarily is a move across the board to more flexible exchange rates,” said David Tulk , a senior macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “You can have considerable posturing on the side of politicians and that creates a very difficult environment for businesses and even households to make decisions.” Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said this week he’s ready to explain to G-7 counterparts the country’s reasons for carrying out foreign-exchange intervention. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today rejected U.S. and European pressure for a faster appreciation of its currency. “If the yuan isn’t stable, it will bring disaster to China and the world,” Wen told a business conference before an European Union-China summit in Brussels today. Inflation Risk European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said yesterday that China’s moves have been “not exactly what we would have hoped ourselves.” China must allow further flexibility in its currency, Macklem said, or risk creating rapid inflation in its domestic market. “We have seen some appreciation of the renminbi but not enough,” he said. “The Chinese real exchange rate needs to appreciate, and that adjustment will happen one way or the other.” The yuan has risen about 2 percent versus the dollar since the People’s Bank of China in June pledged greater flexibility in the currency after pegging it at about 6.83 for two years. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said today that a “damaging dynamic” of large economies keeping their currencies undervalued can cause inflation and asset bubbles, and called on countries to coordinate their policies. He said at a speech in Washington that currencies are “inherently a multilateral issue. It’s much easier to solve if countries come together and do things to complement each other.” ‘Struggle’ “It’s a struggle for all of these economies to weaken their currency,” said Tulk. “The reality is the U.S. dollar is going to remain fundamentally weak because they are the biggest player right now in terms of contemplating quantitative easing.” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his colleagues have signaled they may announce the purchase of more Treasuries as soon as their next policy meeting on Nov. 2-3 in an effort to boost growth and cut an unemployment rate stuck near 10 percent. “The irony is that the Fed is creating all this liquidity with the hope that it will revive the U.S. economy. It is doing nothing for the U.S. economy and causing chaos for the rest of the world,” Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize-winning professor at New York’s Columbia University, said yesterday in New York. Japan sold the yen last month for the first time in six years to spur exports and economic growth, joining countries across Asia and Latin America that have sought to temper gains in their currencies against the dollar. International Moves The Bank of Japan this week cut its overnight call rate target from 0.1 percent and established a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy government bonds and other assets. It moved following the yen’s surge to a 15-year high last month, which hurts exports and damps economic growth. At the Bank of England, policy maker Adam Posen made the strongest call yet on Sept. 28 for the U.K. central bank to resume asset purchases after keeping its bond-buying program at 200 billion pounds ($317 billion) for the past 11 months. Earlier this year, the G-20 agreed to implement policies to boost demand, including promoting exchange-rate flexibility and ensuring sustainable government deficits. Macklem said that must be a focus of this year’s G-20 gatherings. “In the meetings to come in Washington and Korea there will be considerable discussion of the full implementation of the agreements that were taken in Toronto,” Macklem said. “What we need is full implementation of that plan.” The renewed push for easier monetary policy comes as the IMF today said many advanced nations such as the U.S. have yet to adopt policies that will reduce their reliance on government spending and strengthen household demand and exports. At the same time, developing nations such as China are keeping their currencies weak and remain overly dependent on overseas sales to spur growth, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook report said.

Principal had 13,373 workers as of Dec. 31, compared with 13,527 a year earlier, according to the insurer’s annual report today. The figure was 16,585 at the end of 2007. Chief Executive Officer Larry Zimpleman began exiting health insurance in 2010, and job cuts are tied to the wind-down of that unit, said Susan Houser , a company spokeswoman.

Principal acquired Chilean pension manager AFP Cuprum SA this month for about $1.5 billion as it expands in emerging markets. “Apart from the planned three-year exit of our health insurance business, we actually had new job growth in other businesses,” Houser wrote in an e-mail. “We also were able to reabsorb far more employees impacted by the health exit into open positions in other businesses than we had originally estimated.” Principal shares gained about 23 percent in the past 12 months including dividends, beating the 20 percent return of the 22-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index.

{"headline": "Disney’s ‘Monsters University’ Back as No. 1 Weekend Film", "article": "Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s “Monsters University” retained the top spot in U.S. and Canadian theaters for a second weekend, taking in $45.6 million in sales for the company’s Pixar studio. “The Heat,” an R-rated action/comedy pairing Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy as Boston cops, opened in second with $39.1 million for Twentieth Century Fox, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in a statement. The other new release, Sony Corp. (6758) ’s “White House Down,” was fourth with $24.9 million, less than the $35 million to $41.6 million forecast. “Monsters University,” a prequel to the 2001 hit “Monsters Inc.,” adds to the hit movies from Pixar. Disney bought the studio for $7.01 billion in 2006 as part of a plan to reinvigorate its animation business and focus on higher-profile movies with brigher profit prospects. It’s since bought Marvel Entertainment, producer of “The Avengers” and “ Iron Man ,” and Lucasfilm Ltd., owner of “ Star Wars .” “With Pixar, you do enough of them, but don’t flood the market with them and you promote the brands and the merchandising, it speaks to the success,” said Martin Pyykkonen , an analyst with Wedge Partners in Greenwood Village , Colorado. ‘Lone Ranger’ In the latest film, the young monsters Mike and Sulley arrive at college to train for coveted jobs scaring human children, whose screams generate the electricity that powers their alternate society. Since opening, “Monsters University” has taken in $170.4 million, according to Hollywood.com. Disney will veer from its franchise formula on July 3 when it opens “The Lone Ranger,” based on the 1950s television series about a masked gunman who roamed the 19th century American West righting wrongs. In the new version, Armie Hammer plays the title character and Johnny Depp plays Tonto, his Native American partner. Also opening next week is “Despicable Me 2,” a sequel to the 2010 animated hit from Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal Pictures. In “The Heat,” Bullock plays an arrogant though by-the-book FBI agent. Problems arise when she is paired with a foul-mouthed Boston detective, played by McCarthy, to investigate a drug lord. The movie, made for an estimated $43 million, was forecast to take in $42.2 million by Box Office Mojo and $34 million by Boxoffice.com. The film had a 64 percent favorable rating on Rottentomatoes.com. Odd Couple “Bullock specializes in awkward and uptight, McCarthy in aggressive and unfiltered. ‘The Heat’ makes the most of those differences,” Los Angeles Times critic Betsy Sharkey wrote of the movie. “White House Down,” stars Channing Tatum as a police officer who is rejected for a job protecting the U.S. president, played by Jamie Foxx. He ends up as the president’s unofficial bodyguard when, while taking his daughter on a White House tour, terrorists attack. In “World War Z,” Pitt stars as a retired United Nations investigator who is called on to discover the origins of a virus that can turn humans into zombies in a matter of seconds. The film, based on Max Brooks’s novel, has taken $123.7 million since it opened. Weekend revenue for the top 12 films fell 7.1 percent to $183 million from the year-earlier period, Hollywood.com Box-Office said. Attendance is down 1.5 percent this year, while revenue is 1.7 percent lower at $5.29 billion. The following table has U.S. movie box-office figures provided by studios to Hollywood.com Box-Office.

{"headline": "Peru to Declare Mines Strike Illegal, Pinilla Says", "article": "Peru 's government will declare a two- day national mining strike illegal today, forcing miners to return to work or lose their jobs, Labor Minister Susana Pinilla said.  The strike, which seeks to pressure companies to improve pensions, profit-sharing and rights for subcontracted workers, is ``politically motivated,'' Pinilla told Lima-based CPN Radio.  ``Union leaders have a different stance that has nothing to do with worker vindication,'' Pinilla said. ``They have led workers into an illegal strike where they could lose their jobs.''  Strikes this year, including a five-day national walkout by Peruvian miners in May, have cut copper output in Peru, Chile and Mexico , helping to spur a 17 percent rally in the price of the metal. Peru is the world's third- largest producer of copper, zinc and tin, the biggest of silver and fifth-largest of gold.  The stoppage in Peru has affected mines owned by companies including Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) and Doe Run Resources Corp.  Workers also are on strike at mines run by Cia. De Minas Buenaventura SA, tin miner Minsur SA (MINSURI1) , Shougang Hierroperu's iron mine and zinc producers Cia. Minera Raura SA and Cia. Minera Santa Luisa, according to Mining Federation spokesman Cirilo Yarihuaman.  Talks Planned  Southern Copper's Peruvian mines, where 20 percent of workers went on strike, don't expect production losses, parent Grupo Mexico said in a filing to the Mexican Stock Exchange.  National metals output hasn't been cut and only 6,300 workers, or 5.3 percent of Peru's miners, are on strike, Pinilla said. The Mining Federation put the number at 45,000.  Union leaders planned to hold talks with Cabinet chief Jorge del Castillo and the president of Congress, Luis Gonzales Posada, to pass laws granting miners a 10 percent share of profits, up from the current 8 percent, and eight-hour shifts instead of the 12 hours imposed at many mines, Yarihuaman said.  The federation, which represents 70 unions and 28,000 miners, also wants 85,000 subcontracted workers put on company payrolls.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 3.95 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.3415 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Zinc rose $95, or 3.5 percent, to $2,820 a metric ton in London trading, and tin rose $345, or 2.1 percent, to $17,095 a ton.  Silver for December delivery rose 59.5 cents, or 4 percent, to $15.38 an ounce. Gold for December delivery rose $12.60, or 1.6 percent, to $823.40 an ounce.  ``The strike in Latin America is quite supportive to prices,'' Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in London, said today by phone.

{"headline": "Sino-Forest Short Seller Carson Block Says China Consumption ‘Overblown’", "article": "Carson Block, the short seller who runs research firm Muddy Waters LLC, said U.S. investors are too eager to put their money into China where consumer demand is overstated. “The idea of the Chinese consumer has always been somewhat overblown,” Block said yesterday on a panel at a Bloomberg Link Conference in New York. “Part of the reason for that is that you have luxury-goods manufacturers such as Louis Vuitton that report outstanding sales in China.” Muddy Waters research alleging Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) had overstated timber holdings prompted a 67 percent slump in the company’s shares. Sino-Forest has denied the allegations. Businesses are turning to China to bolster sales as rising unemployment and government indebtedness damp confidence in developed nations. Foreign direct investment in China climbed 11.1 percent in August from a year earlier, a government report showed yesterday, as the nation’s growth encourages companies from Volkswagen AG to Caterpillar Inc. to expand. Inflows of overseas cash are inhibiting Premier Wen Jiabao’s campaign to control inflation, while higher interest rates and tighter lending limits are undermining attempts to make consumers a bigger driver of the world’s second-largest economy. Chinese government data last week showed retail sales growth slowed to 17 percent in August, less than the average of the past five years. Shiny Buildings Analysts at Capital Economics , a London-based research group, estimate that private consumption in China may have fallen to 34 percent of gross domestic product last year, the lowest level since the country began opening its economy to market mechanisms more than three decades ago. Just 10 years ago, the share was 46 percent, Capital Economics calculates. “We see the tall, shiny buildings in Shanghai or Beijing and we meet with the Chinese who have graduated from Harvard, who have somewhat been inculcated with western values, and we mistakenly extrapolate this to the large portion of the economy,” Block said. Sales of luxury goods in the world’s most populous nation are projected to surge eightfold to 74 billion euros ($103 billion) in the 10 years to 2020, according to Credit Agricole SA’s CLSA Asia Pacific Markets unit. Asia accounted for 28 percent of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ’s revenue in the six months through June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Paris-based maker of Celine handbags and TAG Heuer watches reported a 25 percent increase in first-half profit on July 26. Shares of Hong Kong- and Mississauga, Ontario-based Sino- Forest have slumped 67 percent in Toronto since Muddy Waters issued research questioning the company’s timber holdings on June 2. Canada ’s main securities watchdog said some Sino-Forest directors may have engaged in acts “related to its securities” that they “knew or should have known” perpetuated a fraud. Block had a short position on Sino-Forest shares, as disclosed in the report. Short selling is the sale of borrowed shares with the hope of profiting when they fall.

{"headline": "Wealthy in U.S. Prioritize Gains Over Safety, BofA Says", "article": "Millionaires have reversed their priorities in the past year to focus on making money rather than preserving it as they wait to move their cash into stocks. About 60 percent of individuals with at least $3 million in investable assets said asset growth is a higher priority than preservation, according to an annual survey by Bank of America Corp. ’s U.S. Trust unit being released tomorrow. In 2012, 58 percent of respondents said protecting their wealth was more important than seeking higher returns in riskier investments. The attitude change hasn’t translated into action by most, said Keith Banks, president of U.S. Trust. More than half of those surveyed, or 56 percent, said they hold a large amount of money in cash accounts. Sixteen percent said they plan to move the money in the next couple of months. “People are recognizing the equity market is back,” Banks said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “Their mindset has shifted but they’re not connecting the dots.” Affluent investors will shift more cash into equities once they gain more confidence in the economy and job growth, Banks said. Last year, the wealthy pointed to uncertainties about European debt and the U.S. presidential election as reasons for avoiding stocks, Banks said. While they’ve talked less about those issues in 2013, some families haven’t invested their cash after gains in the stock market, he said. “Now people are saying: ‘I missed it,’” Banks said. Market Rally The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) of stocks returned 31 percent in the 12 months ended May 17. Investors poured money into bond funds and cash accounts after the 2008 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 dropped 38 percent during the year. While U.S. stock mutual funds attracted $21.5 billion in the three months ended March 31, the most in a quarter since 2004, fixed income continued to lead asset classes, according to Morningstar Inc. (MORN) Taxable-bond funds saw deposits of $69.1 billion in the first quarter, the Chicago-based researcher said. Wealthy investors have become less risk averse, Banks said. About 37 percent this year said pursuing a higher return even with more risk is a priority, compared with 30 percent in 2012. Fifty-two percent of those surveyed said they don’t consider themselves more financially secure today than five years ago, in part because of a sense that their situation could change at any time. Eighty-six percent said a long-term buy-and-hold approach is the best investment strategy and about 40 percent said they plan to gradually invest their cash holdings over 12 to 24 months. The survey didn’t ask respondents to give a value or percentage of their holdings in cash. Generation Y Investors ages 18 to 32, known as Generation Y, were among the most wariest in terms of equities, survey data show. About half said investing in the stock market is overrated, compared with 19 percent of Baby Boomers ages 49 to 67. The U.S. Trust survey was based on responses from 711 non-U.S. Trust clients over age 18, each of whom said they had $3 million or more in assets not including the value of their primary residence. About one-third of respondents had $5 million to $10 million and another third had more than $10 million. It was conducted online by research firm Phoenix Marketing International in February and March. U.S. Trust is part of the global wealth and investment management unit of Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America. It oversees about $332 billion in client balances and serves those who usually have at least $3 million in investable assets.

{"headline": "Commodities Fall for Second Day on Oil Inventories, Fed Minutes", "article": "Commodities fell for a second day as oil tumbled after U.S. stockpiles surged the most since 2008 and as the Federal Reserve signaled it may refrain from more monetary stimulus. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities dropped as much as 2 percent as West Texas Intermediate oil futures, which has a weighting of 30.25 percent in the index , fell after the Energy Department reported inventories rose 9.01 million barrels last week. Gold and silver tumbled as the dollar strengthened after the Fed’s statement. Oil inventories gained as U.S. domestic output rose 2.9 percent to 6.05 million barrels a day, the most since 1999, department data showed. The Fed will refrain from increasing monetary accommodation unless the economic expansion falters or prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target, according to minutes of the March 13 meeting released yesterday. “The fundamentals for the energy sector are bearish,” said John Caruso, a Chicago-based commodities broker at RJO Futures. “Commodities are falling and it’s a direct result from what we’ve heard yesterday with the Fed minutes. Investors are worried and they are parking their money on the sidelines.” The GSCI declined 1.6 percent to 686.35 at 12:02 p.m. Oil for May delivery fell $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $101.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after touching $101.20, the lowest level since Feb. 16. Silver Slips Silver was the biggest decliner in the index. The most active May contract plunged 5.7 percent to $31.385 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Gold for June delivery slumped 3.1 percent to $1,619.60 an ounce on the Comex. The Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the U.S. currency against six counterparts including the euro and the yen, gained 0.4 percent, rising for a second day.

{"headline": "HTC Bets on ’One’ to Break Vicious Cycle of Slumping Sales", "article": "HTC Corp. released its most important smartphone for the year as investors wait to see if HTC One can revive fortunes at a company that’s seen its market share and revenue more than halve in 18 months. Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou took to the stage in London to tout a handset with an aluminum body, a camera that captures three times more light than any other, and new software aimed at differentiating it from competitors including Samsung Electronics Co. , Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. “We see this as a huge opportunity for us to bring new excitement to the smartphone experience,” Chou said. “We as an industry need a new approach to the smartphone.” HTC’s global smartphone ranking dropped to eighth in the fourth quarter, from fourth six quarters prior, as Asian rivals offer a mix of cheaper and more-advanced devices to consumers from Europe to Asia. With its stock down more than 70 percent since a peak in 2011, success of HTC One will be key to whether profit can rebound after five quarters of decline. “This is their most important product for the year and will determine whether earnings double or halve in 2013,” said Lu Chia-lin , who rates the stock hold at Daiwa Securities Group in Taipei. “They’re already in a vicious cycle of failed launches leading to lower brand awareness which hurts future releases.” ‘Halo Product’ HTC posted earnings per share last year of NT$20.16, down from NT$73.32 a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A successful product release could boost EPS to NT$40 this year, while a “mediocre” device may see it fall to NT$10, Lu said by phone. Its shares fell 0.7 percent to NT$280 as of 10:09 a.m. in Taipei today, taking its decline this year to 6.8 percent compared with a 4.2 percent gain in the benchmark Taiex index. This year’s decline follows a 40 percent drop last year and a 42 percent slide in 2011. HTC One includes front-facing stereo speakers, a 4.7-inch 1080p full high-definition display and a Qualcomm Inc. Snapdragon 600 1.7 Gigahertz quad-core processor. Models with 4G LTE Internet will be available in some markets, it said. “I could see it being a hero product for them, a halo product,” said David McQueen , an analyst for market researcher Informa Telecoms & Media in London. Among the new software is BlinkFeed, an application that updates news, photos and social media in real time on the handset’s home screen. HTC Zoe transforms photos into three- second videos, and HTC Sense TV acts as an interactive program guide and television remote control. Revenue Drop “Smartphones are going to go from being smart to being alive,” AOL Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong said at the London event while showing content features of the HTC One. “It’s going to serve a real consumer need, which is getting instantaneous updates from content.” HTC’s revenue last quarter dropped to NT$60 billion ($2 billion), less than half the NT$124 billion it posted in the second quarter of 2011 when it was the world’s fourth-largest smartphone vendor at 10.7 percent share. Its plunge to eighth, with a 3.1 percent share, puts it behind BlackBerry, according to data from Bloomberg Industries and IDC Corp. Component shortages and product defects hampered sales of the One series of handsets, which were unveiled in February last year and released in April with three basic models -- V, S and X -- for the low, middle and high-end. “They need to avoid a repeat of last year’s HTC One series which had many complaints right from launch,” said Jeff Pu , who rates HTC add at Fubon Financial Holding Co. in Taipei. HTC will benefit from stronger support from mobile operators seeking alternatives to the iPhone, which commands higher operator subsidies that cut into profits, Pu said. Over 185 operators will offer the device starting from March, HTC said. That’s more than the 140 which sold the One X last year, Pu said.

{"headline": "Rosneft Still Weighing Arctic, Swap Deal Before May 16 Deadline on BP Deal", "article": "BP Plc (BP/) remains “optimistic” of agreeing on a share swap with state-run OAO Rosneft as a May 16 to reach a deal approaches. Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, is still weighing its decision, Rustam Kazharov, a spokesman for the Moscow-based company, said by phone today. An arbitration court ruled on May 6 that the share swap may go ahead if Rosneft agrees to replace BP in an Arctic exploration deal with the U.K. company’s local venture, TNK-BP. “I can’t comment about time but I’m sure we’ll see a deal sooner or later,” BP Chief Executive Officer Robert Dudley said today in St. Gallen , Switzerland. BP’s billionaire partners in TNK-BP won an injunction in February on the Rosneft alliance, saying their shareholder agreement gives their 50-50 venture exclusive rights to pursue opportunities in Russia. The BP-Rosneft alliance was set to become Dudley’s biggest deal since becoming head of the U.K. producer following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill last year. TNK-BP, set up in 2003, made BP the biggest foreign producer in Russia and now accounts for a quarter of BP’s output and a fifth of its reserves. Five years later, the billionaires, represented by a group called AAR, ousted Dudley as head of TNK- BP as part of their resolution of a shareholder battle over strategy. Tribunal on TNK-BP Rosneft agreed on April 14, the day the swap agreement initially expired, to move the deadline to May 16, giving BP and the billionaires a month more for arbitration. The tribunal on May 6 allowed BP to swap 5 percent of its shares for about 9.5 percent of Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, as long as Rosneft agrees to take on TNK-BP as its partner for Kara Sea exploration. The stakes, each valued at about $7.8 billion when the alliance was announced on Jan. 14, may be held for investment purposes only, and neither Rosneft nor BP is allowed seats on each other’s boards, according to the tribunal. “The company will make a decision that best meets its shareholders’ interests,” Kazharov said, declining to give a timeframe on a decision. “The company wants to take a very balanced approach to making a decision.” Kara Sea Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov said it needs BP’s expertise to explore offshore Arctic resources, rather than a partnership with TNK-BP. The Kara Sea blocks Rosneft offered to BP contain as much as 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent. \"TNK-BP is unlikely get into the project on the back of the court ruling,\" Lev Snykov and Svetlana Grizan, analysts at VTB Capital, said in a May 10 research. Rosneft could ally with another producer, buy out AAR jointly with BP, or, “somewhat less likely,” BP’s stake with AAR, the analysts said. BP offered its partners participation in the Arctic, cash and international projects to allow BP to proceed with the Rosneft deal, Dudley said last month. The Russian partners also rejected a $27 billion buyout offer from BP and Rosneft. A BP and Rosneft alliance is “attractive” and the two companies are continuing talks, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said today, declining to comment on TNK-BP.

{"headline": "Real’s Slump Prompts Brazil Soybeans Farmers to Accelerate Oilseed Exports", "article": "Soybean growers in Brazil , the world’s second-largest producer, are stepping up the pace of sales from the new crop after the local currency plunged 16 percent this month, boosting revenue from dollar-denominated exports, the Celeres crop-research group said. Growers have sold about 20 percent of the crop to be harvested next year, up from a five-year average of about 17 percent to 18 percent, said Leonardo Menezes, an analyst for the Uberlandia, Brazil-based group. Celeres will release a report on sales on Sept. 26. “From Mato Grosso to Parana state, growers all over Brazil are speeding up sales,” Menezes said in a telephone interview today. “The dollar’s rise has been surprisingly steep and it didn’t go unnoticed by farmers.” The Brazilian real’s drop against the dollar this month makes it the second-worst performer among 17 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Brazil will produce a record 75.2 million tons of soybeans next year, up from 74.9 million tons this year, Celeres said. Planting starts this month and the harvest begins by January. The dollar’s rally “more than compensates” for a drop in soybean prices, Menezes said. “By selling next year’s crop in advance, farmers are securing a profit margin of as much as 40 percent,” he said. “That’s pretty amazing.” Soybean futures have fallen 11 percent this month on concerns that Europe ’s debt crisis will curb demand for food and animal feed. Contracts for November delivery fell 37.5 cents, or 2.8 percent, to close at $12.83 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the eighth decline in nine sessions. The U.S. is the world’s largest soybean producer.

{"headline": "South Africa Cricket Coach Gary Kirsten Won’t Renew Contract", "article": "South Africa cricket coach Gary Kirsten won’t renew his contract in order to spend more time with his family. Kirsten, 45, was appointed for two years in August 2011, with an option to renew for another two years. He had to inform Cricket South Africa by April 30 whether he wanted to exercise the option. “Gary has a young family and it is understandable that he wishes to spend more time at home,” CSA President Chris Nenzani said in a statement. “I would like to thank him for his tremendous contribution to the well-being of the Proteas over the past two years.” The ICC Champions Trophy in England and Wales next month will be Kirsten’s final tournament in charge. “I would like to thank Cricket South Africa for the confidence they showed in entrusting me with the fortunes of the national team,” Kirsten said. “It has been a huge privilege to represent my country as player and coach and to have been given the responsibility of growing the team.” South Africa moved to the top of the International Cricket Council’s Test rankings last August with a 2-0 series win over then-No. 1 England. The Proteas also topped the one-day and Twenty20 rankings at one point last year, becoming the first team to hold the No. 1 spot in all three formats of the game at the same time. They currently rank fourth in ODI and sixth in Twenty20. With the Proteas set to tour Sri Lanka and July and August and then host India and Australia next season, Nenzani said “it is important that we move quickly to identify” Kirsten’s successor. “Gary certainly leaves the Proteas in good health and, although we are disappointed to lose him as head coach, he has put the foundations in place to carry us forward,” he said. Kirsten coached India to the World Cup title on home soil in 2011 before taking over South Africa. He scored 7,289 runs in 101 Test matches as an opening batsman for the Proteas, and also scored 6,789 runs in 185 one-day matches.

{"headline": "Auto Sales May Top Analysts’ Earlier Estimates on Jobs Recovery", "article": "U.S. automobile sales this year may rise faster than analysts had earlier anticipated as the improving job market prevents higher gasoline prices and supply disruptions in Japan from derailing the industry’s recovery. Total sales of cars and light trucks may rise to 13 million this year, the average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The average estimate was 12.9 million in a Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts in January. Light-vehicle sales last year rose to 11.6 million from a 27-year low in 2009. Auto sales ran at seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.1 million in the first quarter, the fastest pace since the quarter ending June 2008, according to Autodata Corp. Demand held up while gasoline prices rose to the highest in more than two years and Japan’s earthquake disrupted production and tightened inventories of some models. “Despite it all, people still need cars,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at industry researcher Edmunds.com, which kept its estimate at 12.9 million. “There’s still that issue of pent-up demand that we see in the marketplace that you can’t ignore.” The U.S. economy added jobs for six consecutive months through March, with payrolls rising by 478,000 in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent, according to Labor Department figures. Seven analysts raised their estimates for full-year auto sales since the beginning of the year. IHS Automotive lowered its estimate to 12.9 million vehicles, from as high as 13.3 million in February, citing higher oil prices and disruptions following Japan’s earthquake. Oil Prices, Japan The higher cost of oil accounts for a 150,000-vehicle reduction in IHS’s estimate, and Japan-related production losses account for the remainder, said George Magliano, a New York- based senior economist for the researcher. “We’re a little more optimistic on the job market, which we think has finally turned,” Magliano said in a telephone interview. “Credit has begun to loosen up a bit more. That made us feel better about where the year was going. Now, we’ve got two things working against us.” U.S. consumer borrowing rose for a fifth straight month in February on an increase in non-revolving credit, which includes borrowing for autos, the Federal Reserve reported April 7. Lenders began expanding credit to new-car buyers last year, according to Experian Automotive, which tracks auto-lending data. Buyers with nonprime or weaker credit scores accounted for 19.8 percent of the new-vehicle financing market in the fourth quarter, up from 16.8 percent a year earlier, Costa Mesa, California-based Experian said. Credit Expands “The lenders are coming to the consumers, and the consumers are doing everything they can to improve their standing so they can hopefully meet in the middle,” said Dan Montague, an analyst at the Autofacts forecasting unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which raised its estimate for full- year deliveries to 13 million from 12.5 million. Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest U.S. automaker, closed its truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky , last week because of a Japan-related parts shortage. The factory makes F-Series pickups and the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs, according to Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford’s website. General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S. automaker, also reported production disruptions the week of March 21 at its pickup plant in Shreveport, Louisiana , and factories in Zaragoza, Spain , and Eisenach, Germany. ‘Temporary’ Japan Impact Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, has said it lost 140,000 units of production from March 14 to March 26, citing a shortage of electronic parts, rubber and plastics. The company said today it may lose output of 35,000 vehicles at its North American factories through April 25. A shortage of vehicles for Japan-based automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. will be a temporary headwind, said Efraim Levy , an analyst with Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, which kept its 13 million 2011 sales estimate. “There will be some makeup of those sales in the second half of the year, but in general consumers will mostly opt to find an alternative vehicle and purchase now, rather than wait,” said Levy, who’s based in New York. “That’s a potential benefit to U.S. and Korean automakers and a minor impact on overall sales for the year.” GM repeated this month its forecast that sales this year may be as much as 13.5 million when including medium- and heavy- duty trucks. A “significant slowdown” as a result of the Japan earthquake is unlikely, said Don Johnson, Detroit-based GM’s vice president of U.S. sales, said on a conference call. Pent-Up Demand “The biggest problem I have is not having enough cars, and that’s about the best problem to have,” said Robert Morris, president of a Cadillac, Buick and GMC dealership in North Olmsted, Ohio , near Cleveland. “People can only stay down for so long before they just kind of snap themselves out of it. The pent-up demand is breaking loose.” The sales estimates compiled by Bloomberg range from as high as 14 million predicted by Morgan Stanley (MS) to 12.6 million projected by AutoPacific Inc. More of the labor force is settling for part-time work, which is skewing a recovery in the job market, said Ed Kim, an analyst at AutoPacific in Tustin, California. “Part-time work generally doesn’t cut it as far as having the income necessary to buy a new vehicle,” said Kim, who raised his estimate to 12.6 million vehicles from 12.4 million at the beginning of the year. “I don’t think that necessarily translates into a significantly higher number of consumers who can buy a new vehicle now.” Annual U.S. deliveries were 16.8 million on average from 2000 to 2007, according to Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Autodata. The following table shows estimates for 2011 light-vehicle sales in the U.S. Estimates are in millions of vehicles.

{"headline": "A New Dawn for Zimbabwe?", "article": "For many years travelers have avoided Zimbabwe, aware that the country was ruled by a brutal regime. But Robert Mugabe’s time is growing short, safari lodges are filling up, and the spectacular wildlife is flourishing again. I'm having lunch on the terrace of the Victoria Falls Hotel, something I never would have done a few years ago. Even now, as I look out over the manicured lawns and the baboons and spider monkeys romping among the trees, I am uneasy. When Robert Mugabe's power as leader of Zimbabwe was at its cruel height, this hotel provided the dictator with a reliable flow of hard currency and served as a showpiece of the dictatorship. Mugabe's men could point to the tourists here and say, \"See, everything is normal.\" I didn't want to be part of that charade. Today Mugabe, eighty-eight and ailing, still rules the country with an iron fist. There is a sense, though, that his time is almost up. The economy is in the hands of Tendai Biti, a leader of the opposition who has a reputation for honesty. Animals are no longer perishing in great numbers; poaching has fallen off; and tourists are starting to come back to Zimbabwe. Earlier, midway through Mugabe's rule, the country was still an enchanting place to be. When I came on safari in 1990, I followed elephants on foot with an Afrikaner guide through the sweeping savanna of Hwange, the country's largest national park; stayed in colonial-style luxury on a houseboat in Lake Kariba; and paddled with a young black guide down the hippo-filled Zambezi River, sleeping on the sandy banks at night. But when I was here in 2005, I saw a country reeling from drought and corruption. Hwange was in ruins—its animals were dying of thirst and disease because the government couldn't afford to keep the water holes filled. This time, everywhere I go on my ten-day tour, I'm struck by the beauty, the abundance of wildlife, and the optimism that's taking hold. Old journalist friends I speak with in Harare sound relieved, at times amazed, at how things have settled down, and note new restaurants and weekend getaways to game parks as signs of stability. \"At last it's possible to imagine having a real life here,\" BBC producer Firle Davies, who recently moved back to Zimbabwe, tells me. I look around the packed terrace. The hotel bottomed out in 2008, when the occupancy rate sank to twenty-five percent and menu prices had to be changed hourly to keep up with inflation. \"Everything was out of stock,\" says my lunch companion, the hotel's general manager, Karl Snater. \"The staff were not earning a fair wage.\" Beyond the garden, I can hear the distant roar of Victoria Falls, which has symbolized the continent's natural splendor ever since 1855, when the Scottish explorer David Livingstone became the first European to set eyes on the cataract—called Mosi-oa-Tunya, or the Smoke that Thunders, by the Makololo tribe. Snater tells me that occupancy is now up to fifty-five percent and the hotel will turn a profit for the first time in a decade. The idea that this combustive country of twelve million blacks and fewer than a hundred thousand whites may be emerging from Mugabe's ruinous reign is a seductive one. The sad history is well known: Mugabe, hailed as a liberation hero when he took power in 1980, devolved into a despot who dispatched underlings to beat and kill opponents. He seized three thousand white-owned farms and handed them out to cronies and wovits, \"war vets\" of the country's liberation battles (fought between 1972 and 1979)—unemployed, uneducated men, mostly from rural areas, who served as the regime's shock troops. Agriculture collapsed, factories closed, and unemployment skyrocketed. Hyper­inflation made the Zimbabwe dollar worthless. People were starving. A severe drought in 2005 brought further misery. The country's wildlife suffered horribly. Hungry Zimbabweans hunted the animals for food. Some of the worst slaughter was taking place on private white-owned farms and game reserves overrun by wovits and poor squatters. In 2007, the World Wildlife Fund estimated that eighty percent of wildlife on such private land had been killed. In November 2010, a Zimbabwean camper was attacked by a pride of lions while showering outdoors at a fishing camp near Mana Pools; conservationists suggested that the killing was the result of \"traumatized\" wildlife being pushed off private land by wovits and seeking sanctuary in the national park. And between 2006 and 2009, Zimbabwe lost more than twenty-five percent of its rhino population to poaching. The reasons for the recent positive turn are multi-fold. Violence against white Zimbabweans has dropped dramatically, partly because most white farms have already been seized but also because of pressure put on Mugabe since 2009 by South African president Jacob Zuma and other regional leaders. In recent years, foreign investors have started renovating lodges and putting money into new hotels and safari camps. This has been aided by Zimbabwe's adopting the U.S. dollar, as well as the fact that Mugabe was forced in 2008 to share power with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, led by Morgan Tsvangirai. And all this, of course, has led to a noticeable increase in visitors to Zimbabwe's famed parks and reserves: Tourism revenues have climbed to about $26 million annually—still a long way from the $777 million peak in 1999. This is all happening despite the fact that Mugabe is still around—evidenced by threats against opposition supporters and the eviction of pro-opposition Anglican priests from their homes. While the government is now in theory a coalition, Mugabe still controls the army, the police, and the courts. \"One side has all the power, and the opposition is desperately fighting for space,\" a human rights activist in Harare tells me. The day before I arrive, retired general Solomon Mujuru, a onetime Mugabe associate who turned against him, was found burned to death in his farmhouse. Mugabe called the death accidental. The single-engine Cessna 206 touches down at dusk on a dirt airstrip in Hwange National Park, 5,600 square miles of acacia groves, savanna grass, and mopani scrub on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Created by the British in 1928, Hwange stood as a model of African wildlife conservation. Lacking natural sources of water during the dry season, the park owes its existence to eighty man-made ponds, or pans, filled by pumps that bring groundwater from hundreds of feet beneath the surface.  Even during the worst of the Mugabe years, this fragile system managed to support one of Africa's largest concentrations of elephants—between 25,000 and 30,000. And with 105 species of mammals here, including herds of buffalo, eland, zebras, sables, and wildebeests, along with 250 lions, Hwange also has one of the highest levels of biodiversity of any game park in Africa. I've barely left the airstrip when the first herd comes into view: two hundred Cape buffalo shambling along the savanna, a pair of jackals prowling at the edge.  I'm on my way to Little Makalolo, a lodge operated by Wilderness Safaris. After the economy imploded, Wilderness Safaris—whose concession, with four tented camps, occupies seven percent of Hwange—considered closing up shop. Most of the two dozen other lodges and tented camps in the park went out of business. But the company's directors diverted income from Botswana operations and funds from its nonprofit Wilderness Wildlife Fund to pay the Hwange camp's staff and keep its dozen water holes running. \"When there was a drought and no fuel, forty percent of the animals in the whole park migrated to our concession,\" says Sibahle \"Sibs\" Sibanda, a guide, as we walk from the rustic lodge to my luxury tent through a grove of leadwood trees.  Poaching, while still an issue, has receded, a strong disincentive being the authorization of anti-poaching patrols to shoot to kill (if fired upon). Last May, two rhino poachers were killed by an anti-poaching squad at the edge of Hwange Park. There are also gentler approaches: Dean McGregor, a safari guide at Bumi Hills Safari Lodge in Matusadona National Park, helps run an unarmed anti-poaching unit that removes wire snares and frees trapped animals. \"Poachers were trucking meat out of here in the backs of pickups and selling it in the villages,\" he told me. \"We've been repopulating the area with game. You would not have seen animals like this a couple years ago. It was desolate.\" And to help fight hunger—the main reason for illegal bush-meat poaching—Wilderness Safaris runs a program that feeds children in surrounding communities.  Encouraged, new players are emerging in Hwange. Among the most enterprising is Beks Ndlovu, a thirty-five-year-old former guide who owns Somalisa Camp. Somalisa is in a grove of acacia trees at the edge of a pan that draws a steady flow of animals throughout the day, including a breeding herd of elephants which appear at sunset to drink. I chat with Ndlovu, one of the country's most successful black safari operators, on a teak deck leading to a small swimming pool, where guests sip drinks while bobbing in the chilly water, waiting for the elephants to arrive. In 2005, Ndlovu, who grew up near Hwange, saw an opportunity. \"The white tour operators were put out of business. They left and went to Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, other neighboring countries,\" he says. \"The parks department was desperate to revive tourism in Hwange and bring in some revenue.\" With a handful of European investors, he put in an offer for a concession in Hwange. He's now turning a profit and operates another tent camp in Zimbabwe's Mana Pools National Park and two more in Botswana.  Ndlovu tells me he believes the unity government has provided the economic stability to attract tourism. As we sit talking on the deck, I hear a rustle in the trees, and a procession of elephants approaches the pan. The animals—mothers and calves, including two wobbly infants—crowd around the water hole. A few braver ones approach the swimming pool, where the water apparently tastes better. They're so close that I could lean forward and touch them, but I sit frozen in place, silently observing the spectacle. I head to Mana Pools National Park, seventy miles down the Zambezi from Lake Kariba, where Nick Murray, a trained zoologist, runs the Vundu Camp. Mana Pools is known for its six thousand hippopotamuses, robust herds of elephants, and one of southern Africa’s largest populations of wild dogs. Murray and I are walking through a copse of leadwood and mahogany trees draped in a bright-green creeper known as combretum. In the distance, I hear hippos grunting on the banks of the wide, sluggish Zambezi. Trumpeter hornbills dart overhead, and wild dogs lope through the grass, snouts smeared with blood after a morning antelope kill. “We go through times when we see lions and wild dogs every day,” Murray tells me. “Ten years ago, it might have been two weeks between sightings.” Murray has been a player in Zimbabwe’s racial dramas since he was a boy. His father, a member of a white Rhodesian Army mounted unit called the Grey’s Scouts, fought Mugabe’s freedom fighters during the civil war and was killed in action in 1978, when Nick was nine. In 2003, when many white guides were fleeing the country, Murray and his wife took over a concession along the river from a bankrupt operator. “It was a gamble,” he tells me, “but we wanted to be in the right place if tourism started to build.” War veterans at a government plantation hijacked lumber and forced the Murrays to pay double the agreed-on price; the government made them redo their environmental-impact statement, setting the project back months. In 2008, the Murrays opened Vundu, five canvas tents pitched around a lodge, built on eight-foot-high eucalyptus stilts, with a thatched roof. Life has certainly gotten easier for all Zimbabweans in recent years, but the racial tensions that exploded a decade ago still simmer. A young woman who works in the Murrays’ camp was a neighbor of Mike Campbell’s, a septuagenarian white farmer who had purchased his farm before Zimbabwe’s independence. Campbell later resisted attempts by Mugabe’s men to seize it and, along with his son-in-law Ben Freeth, was abducted, severely beaten, and dumped on the road in 2008; Campbell eventually died from complications of his beating, and his farm was burned to the ground. “It can still happen to any one of us,” the young woman tells me over dinner at the camp. “We’re all potential targets.” Another serious challenge to camp owners is Mugabe’s Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Law, which requires all foreign-owned businesses worth more than $500,000 to cede fifty-one percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans. In January 2011, two hundred wovits invaded the Admiral’s Cabin, a popular white-owned safari lodge and restaurant inside the Kuimba Shiri Bird Park on Lake Chivero. Owner Gary Stafford, who stood his ground with his son, told reporters that the assailants cited the law as justification. “They are saying they want ‘to empower the people,’ ” Stafford says. Several independent newspapers in Zimbabwe have reported that Mugabe’s nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, covets the camp. The repeated blows and threats have taken a toll on Murray, who feels the longer the coalition government is in place, the better for everyone. The alternatives—a corrupt dictator or an inept oppositionist—could be worse: “We need to wait until a qualified leader emerges out of the opposition,” he says—or risk the collapse of renascent tourism and animal conservation efforts. The next day, Murray and I climb into a boat and paddle downstream on the Zambezi. I am eyeing the waters, mindful of a story he told me. Five years ago, a fourteen-foot crocodile had climbed over the stern of his canoe, snatched his backpack and rifle, and made a lunge for him. He shot the reptile between the shoulders with his Magnum pistol, and “the crocodile went into his death roll and took the canoe over with him.” The fierce heat of midday has begun to subside, and I lean back in my bow seat, listening to the rhythmic dipping of Murray’s paddle into the coffee-colored water. To my left, the bush-covered hills of Zambia rise beyond a shoreline studded with fishing camps; to my right in Zimbabwe, thick stands of acacia and mahogany extend to yellow sand banks populated with pods of hippos and solitary crocodiles. The hippos plunge into the river with pig-like grunts, bobbing up and down, eyes following us. We paddle through muddy channels, past islands covered with phragmites, a wetland grass that grows to fifteen feet. Murray keeps an eye out for buffalo and elephants in the thickets. The marsh abounds with malachite kingfishers—tiny birds with turquoise heads and wings and bright-orange breasts—as well as with white egrets, fish eagles, Egyptian geese, and massive Goliath herons. Singita Pamushana Lodge, in the Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, may be a sneak peek into Zimbabwe’s future. The 105,000-acre reserve is owned by the nonprofit Malilangwe Trust, backed by the fifty-seven-year-old hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and some friends, and it embodies the idea that to protect animals you must also offer a livelihood to the neighboring people. Even during Zimbabwe’s hardest years, Singita Pamushana kept local people fed and poachers at bay. A Toyota Land Cruiser takes me from a private airstrip through arid hills speckled with baobab trees to a boom gate, where a golf cart is waiting for me. My cottage could be an Africa theme park on steroids: curving mud-colored walls decorated with chevron patterns of red, green, and white, based on the fabrics of the local Shangaan tribe; shields; beaded chandeliers; an oversized teak bed shrouded in mosquito netting; and a private plunge pool. Five other cottages and one large villa are scattered across the property. In 1995, the trust bought this former ranch and imported thousands of animals, including forty endangered black rhinos and white rhinos from South Africa. It hired seventy scouts to police the property and surrounded it with an electric fence. Over a dinner of parsnip and potato soup with white truffle oil, red snapper fillet, and pumpkin pie with crystallized ginger strips, general manager Jason Turner tells me that three years ago, Pamushana could go two months without a guest. The lodge now averages thirty a month, with celebrities such as Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Shakira turning up. The Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve has one of Africa’s most successful rhino reintroduction and protection programs. The trust also operates irrigation works, community gardens, and a feeding program in the nearby Chiredzi district that provided meals to 45,000 children per day during the worst of Zimbabwe’s food shortages—it now feeds 22,000 kids. But even good guys have to play politics. Singita Pamushana lies in the heart of Zimbabwe’s Masvingo Province, previously a stronghold of Mugabe’s ruling party, and the trust has worked hard to cultivate cordial relations with the local governing council, controlled by a Mugabe loyalist. “When we hear rumblings, people talking negatively about Singita Pamushana, we get information so we can quickly rebut it,” says Turner. The fact that Pamushana is owned by a nonprofit trust—rather than by an individual white owner—“has taken the personalization out of it.” Even so, there have been a few close calls. For two weeks, a gang of wovits camped on an adjacent property while the private security force stood back, wary of picking a fight with an outfit that apparently had Mugabe’s backing. Instead, the council chief and other powerful local politicians persuaded them to leave. Singita Pamushana’s privacy and amenities don’t draw just celebrities. Saadi Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan dictator’s soccer-playing son, came here with six friends during Ramadan in September 2010. The chef worked around the clock, preparing iftar feasts and midnight and pre-dawn meals, while a local documentary filmmaker gave Qaddafi personal tours of the Malilangwe reserve. “He’d gotten three pieces of land [from Mugabe], and he was showing them to me on the map,” says Turner, who spent months pressing the Libyan embassy to pay the six-figure bill. “We were happy to see the last of them.” I head out with Tengwe Siabwanda, a staff guide, to see the animals. Alighting from our vehicle, Siabwanda spots a family of white rhinos (the term—a corruption of wide rhinos—refers to their wide mouth, not their color) grazing in a grove of mopanis, and leads me on hands and knees toward them. We creep to within fifteen yards of the beasts and watch them in silence. I note the massive haunches, the huge horns. Then the rhinos turn and run, crashing through the brush away from us. Speaking by phone from his base in Bulawayo, in southern Zimbabwe, Education Minister David Coltart points out that, though Mugabe’s party still controls the Ministry of Mines, Environment and Tourism (which runs the national parks), most tourist revenue currently flows through the Finance Ministry, which is controlled by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Coltart, a human rights lawyer from Bulawayo who helped found the MDC, is now the only white member of Zimbabwe’s parliament; I’ve met him repeatedly over the years during my clandestine visits to the country and have found him to be one of its most insightful politicians. He sees Mugabe weekly at cabinet meetings, sitting a few seats down the table from the dictator. “Some in civil society may support a boycott—mainly those in exile,” Coltart says. “But I think most would not, and certainly none of the political parties would, including the MDC.” A few leaders of the anti-Mugabe movement—mostly people who are overseas—urge tourists to stay away from Zimbabwe, arguing that entry receipts from the national parks and lease fees paid by safari operators give legitimacy to an outlaw regime. On the other hand, it’s questionable whether Mugabe and his men really care about tourism. Not far from Malilangwe lie the Chiadzwa diamond fields, seized by Zimbabwe’s army in November 2008—where much greater profits are to be made. “The amount of money that Mugabe and his crew get from tourism is insignificant,” says Angus Shaw, the Harare correspondent for the Associated Press and a Zimbabwean who has covered Mugabe since he came to power. He is one of many leading Zimbabweans who believe that Western tourist dollars do far more to protect wildlife and provide employment than they benefit the aging dictator and his friends. “Mugabe has so much money, he doesn’t need tourism,” says Dean McGregor, the safari guide who helps run the Bumi Hills Anti-Poaching Unit. “Maybe if you’ve got aspirations to become a big hotelier, that will attract attention. But nobody in Zimbabwe is going to open a Four Seasons Hotel in the near future. Mugabe doesn’t care about bush camps.” It remains unclear what kind of leadership will come after Mugabe. Prime Minister Tsvangirai, an inspiring campaigner who dared to fight against Mugabe despite getting severely beaten several times, is considered to be honest but has earned a reputation among his critics for being more at home on the golf course than in the halls of government. Ibbo Mandaza, a former freedom fighter, believes that many MDC leaders are more interested in “feeding at the trough” than in governing the country effectively. Nonetheless, there is a sense among everyone I talk to that Zimbabwe will become a new country when Mugabe finally passes from the scene. Smart and dedicated leaders are coming up—including Finance Minister Tendai Biti, who has restored a degree of fiscal responsibility and transparency, and Coltart, who has brought teachers back to work after the collapse of the country’s schools under Mugabe. On my last day, I join Nick Murray, owner of Vundu Camp, for a dawn walk in search of wild dogs. These animals’ survival, he tells me, depends upon both tourists and conservationists; without them, the anti-poaching teams will disintegrate for lack of money, and research will grind to a halt. Standing on the banks of the Zambezi River, listening to Murray talk with such passion about his work, I wonder if tourism might one day play an even bigger role in Zimbabwe’s recovery, pumping more cash into the game reserves, funding additional conservation and research programs, allowing the national parks to become self-sustaining, and providing more jobs for local people. I can envision the Zambezi Valley, Hwange National Park, and the southern bushveld becoming as lucrative as Kenya’s Masai Mara Reserve or South Africa’s Kruger National Park. As the sun rises over Mozambique, across the river, we find the “Vundu pack” on a grassy plot—seventeen feral creatures with black snouts and mottled black-and-yellow fur, in pursuit of a family of warthogs. “They’ll chase them, but they won’t try to kill them,” Murray says. “The warthogs have tusks—they’re too high-risk.” Sure enough, soon the dogs give up and bound back down the road, heading for their den.

{"headline": "Judicial Minimalism Triumphs in Affirmative Action Case", "article": "In today’s affirmative action case, Fisher v. University of Texas , the most important thing to know may be the U.S. Supreme Court’s vote: 7 to 1. With the exception of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , every member of the court joined Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s majority opinion. (Justice Elena Kagan recused herself.) Affirmative action has long divided the justices as well as the nation, and the remarkable near-unanimity of the court speaks volumes. In a little-noticed speech in 2006, Chief Justice John Roberts argued in favor of unanimous decisions from the court, suggesting that unanimity leads to modest, incremental and minimalist rulings. In his words, the “broader the agreement among the justices, the more likely it is a decision on the narrowest possible grounds.” The basic idea is that if a diverse group of justices is able to agree on an opinion, that opinion is more likely to steer clear of intense controversy and avoid the largest theoretical disputes. This, in the chief justice’s view, is entirely desirable, as he explained with an aphoristic summary of the minimalist position in constitutional law: “If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, in my view it is necessary not to decide more.” The chief justice added that the “rule of law is strengthened when there is greater coherence and agreement about what the law is.” Race Factor For 35 years, the law governing affirmative action at public universities has been relatively settled. In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, decided in 1978, Justice Lewis Powell cast the decisive vote. He concluded that the Constitution doesn’t impose a flat ban on affirmative-action programs but that universities must avoid quota systems, and that they are permitted to consider race as a “factor” only if they can demonstrate that doing so is necessary to achieve the educational benefits that come from a diverse student body. In 2003 , a sharply divided court essentially endorsed Powell’s reasoning. The court’s majority held that the Constitution allows flexible, quota-free affirmative-action programs, but also that judges must apply “strict scrutiny” to assess whether such programs are both necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling educational goal. This approach rejects two more extreme positions. Some people, including Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , believe the Constitution calls for colorblindness. They insist that under the Equal Protection Clause, the general rule is that no public institution may take into account the race of a student or applicant. Others, including Justice Thurgood Marshall, have argued that the Equal Protection Clause was designed above all to eliminate a system of racial subordination. In their view, the idea of colorblindness is not part of the Constitution, and judges should uphold affirmative-action programs unless they are genuinely unreasonable. In Fisher, many people hoped -- or feared -- that a majority of the court would take the opportunity to insist on colorblindness. Instead, the court’s brief, technical, narrow opinion reaffirms the constitutional status quo. The central thrust of the opinion is that the federal appeals court that ruled in favor of the Texas program had failed to undertake the careful inquiry required by the Supreme Court ’s precedents. The court of appeals wrongly said that it would defer to a university’s “educational judgment” that diversity “is essential to its educational mission.” Kennedy responded that “it is for courts, not the university administrators,” to decide whether the university’s choice to use race is necessary and narrowly tailored “to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.” Appeals Court The fact that the university was acting in good faith (as emphasized by the court of appeals) wasn’t enough. Federal judges must give “close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice.” Thus, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the appeals court so that it could assess whether the university’s affirmative-action program was, in fact, narrowly tailored. Scalia and Thomas wrote separately to reiterate their view that the Constitution always forbids consideration of race. But for present purposes, what is most important is that both of them were willing to join Kennedy. The court’s ruling is emphatically minimalist in the sense that it breaks no theoretical ground and declines to make novel pronouncements about the nature of the Constitution’s equality principle. Its simple message is that lower courts must apply the principles that the Supreme Court has already established. With that message, it leaves those principles undisturbed. No one should deny that minimalism can produce mistakes. If the Constitution really does require colorblindness, then there may be nothing wrong with a 5-4 decision in favor of colorblindness. And if the court’s precedents are fundamentally wrong, then there is nothing wrong with revisiting them. Nonetheless, Roberts was right to emphasize that a consensus within the court is likely to produce greater stability in the law, and that it tends to produce narrow, humble decisions, too. In this light, it is misleading to say the court “punted” in the Fisher case. On the contrary, the court’s modest, cautious ruling keeps faith with decades of constitutional law -- and declines to destabilize the background against which countless educational institutions, both large and small, have been doing their work.

{"headline": "Assad Running Out of Time, Russia’s Medvedev Says on CNN", "article": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chances of remaining in power are diminishing and he must sit at the negotiating table with all of Syria ’s ethnic and religious groups to bring an end to the country’s civil war, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. Medvedev has called Assad several times urging him to negotiate, the Russian premier said in an interview with CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” program at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The interview is scheduled for broadcast today. The conflict in Syria is a threat to ally Russia as well as Europe and the U.S. because Syria’s opposition is increasingly represented by Islamic radicals who will infiltrate other countries, Medvedev said. The Syrian people must decide their own future through “genuine national dialogue,” he said. Russia’s goal has never been to preserve Syria’s current political regime, he said. “With every day, with every week, with every month, the chances of him surviving are becoming less and less,” Medvedev said through a translator, according to a transcript provided by CNN. “I personally a few times called Assad and said ‘You need to start reforms, you need to sit at the negotiating table.’ Unfortunately, the Syrian authorities turned out not to be ready for this.” Civil War Sunnis, Shiites, Alawites, Druze and Christians need to be represented in efforts to end a civil war for which both sides, the Syrian authorities and the opposition, are responsible, Medvedev said. Syrian rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, have been fighting to oust Assad since March 2011 in a conflict that, according to the United Nations, has left at least 60,000 people dead. Along with winter weather, shortages of food and fuel have increased the hardships for Syrians in cities torn by fighting. Medvedev was also asked about Russia ’s decision to halt U.S. adoptions of Russian children, which he said was motivated by cases of mistreatment of Russian orphans adopted by Americans, and wasn’t retaliation for U.S. actions in the case of Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd., died at the age of 37 while in pre-trial detention after uncovering the biggest known tax fraud in Russian history, a theft of $230 million from the national treasury. The case sparked a diplomatic row, with the U.S. imposing sanctions on Russian officials accused of having a role in Magnitsky’s death. Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian orphans last month. Discussing his own political career, Medvedev said it would have been “pointless” and “counterproductive” to fight against his friend Vladimir Putin to win a second term as president. Medvedev’s switch to the role of prime minister last year as Putin assumed the presidential role “achieved the main goal, to ensure continuity,” he said.

{"headline": "S. Korea’s Power Utilities Pledge to Raise Renewables Portfolios", "article": "South Korea ’s 13 power utilities pledged to increase the use of renewable sources for electricity generation as the government plans an alternative-energy quota in 2012 to reduce emissions. The generators signed contracts with the government to cooperate on meeting the mandatory quotas and to install renewable-energy power generators at all their sites by 2013, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement today. The generators, each with more than 500 megawatts of capacity, include six units of state-run Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP) , Posco Power Corp., GS Power Co. and Korea District Heating Corp. Korea Energy Management Corp. will provide technical and other aid as an accredited approval organization for the renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, according to the statement. The quota will increase investment in cleaner energy as South Korea’s government seeks to bolster the nation’s share of the world markets for solar and wind-power equipment to 15 percent of each by 2015. South Korea had 11 percent of the global solar market and 4 percent of the wind market in 2010, according to government data. The quota for electricity generated by renewable sources will be raised to 10 percent in 2022 from 2 percent in 2012, the ministry said today. As current solar-energy technology is less economically viable, the government will impose separate energy quotas on those generators in the first five years to foster the industry, the ministry said. South Korea announced a voluntary goal in December to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.

{"headline": "Indonesia Takes Steps to Reduce Cash as Interest Rate Held", "article": "Indonesia took steps to reduce excess funds in the economy while extending a pause in interest-rate cuts as a declining currency and the threat of higher fuel prices push up inflation risks. The rupiah rose. Bank Indonesia will raise the rates on central bank bills and term deposits of all tenors starting today to absorb liquidity, it said in Jakarta, without specifying the levels. Governor Darmin Nasution and his board held the reference rate at 5.75 percent, a decision predicted by all 21 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Pressure to reverse monetary easing is mounting in Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy after inflation accelerated to 4.5 percent in April, with the government’s bid to contain fuel subsidies and a weakening rupiah threatening to boost prices. At the same time, a growth slowdown to 6.3 percent last quarter has reduced the scope for raising rates. “This is a signal that BI will start to normalize its monetary policy,” said David Sumual, a Jakarta-based economist at PT Bank Central Asia. “The period for cutting rates is over unless there’s a risk of a deepening global slowdown.” The rupiah climbed 0.9 percent to 9,183 per dollar at 4:05 p.m. in Jakarta, paring its loss this year to about 1 percent. Before today’s central bank measures, the currency had fallen about 2 percent this year, the worst performer after the yen in a basket of 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It fell to its weakest in almost two years last week. Yields Rise The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022 climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to a four- month high of 6.21 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. It’s climbed 17 basis points this week. Asian nations have diverged as some kept rates steady or cut borrowing costs to shield their economies from Europe ’s debt crisis and a growth slowdown in China , while others tightened to limit price gains. Indonesia has kept its benchmark unchanged for three straight meetings since an unexpected reduction in February, while South Korea held borrowing costs at 3.25 percent for the 11th time today. Bank Indonesia is raising the rates of all its monetary instruments of all tenors because of inflationary pressure and the rupiah’s weakness, Hendar, director of monetary policy at the central bank, said today. The purpose is to push up the yields of medium and long-term government bonds , said Hendar, who uses only one name. Preferred Course The central bank sold 7.17 trillion rupiah ($781 million) of nine-month bills at 4.23785 percent and 220 billion rupiah of nine-month Shariah-compliant bills at a yield of 4.23785 percent, it said in a statement today. Tightening via short-term monetary instruments “rather than via the policy rate, is the preferred first course of action,” said Chua Hak Bin, a Singapore-based economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “BI will likely keep the policy rate on hold given the uncertainty over fuel prices and inflation outlook.” Consumer-price pressure is manageable, Bank Indonesia said today, adding it would continue to absorb liquidity in the market. It maintained its gross domestic product growth forecast for the year at 6.3 percent to 6.7 percent. Inflation Target The monetary authority said the rupiah would strengthen, and kept its inflation target for 2012 and 2013 at 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Lending growth was 24.9 percent from a year earlier as of March. The country’s parliament rejected a proposal for a 33 percent increase in subsidized-fuel prices from April 1 after public protests. Lawmakers instead allowed the government to raise prices only if the Indonesia Crude Price exceeds the state budgetary assumption of $105 a barrel by 15 percent over a six month period. Authorities now plan to cap the sale of below market-rate fuel for certain vehicles. “Even if subsidized fuel prices are not raised this year, we would expect headline inflation to get close to 6 percent by year-end, rising further during the course of 2013,” said Robert Prior-Wandesforde , Singapore-based director of Asian economics at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Nevertheless, in view of what we see as a ‘go for growth’ policy in Indonesia, it seems unlikely that the politically sensitive policy rate would be hiked” until inflation is at least half a percentage point higher, he said.

{"headline": "Obama Defends Bailouts, Handouts and Cop-Outs: Steven Greenhut", "article": "State of the Union addresses provide insight into the vision of America embraced by the president, and in that regard Tuesday’s address by President Barack Obama didn’t disappoint. He envisions a country where the federal government protects and creates union jobs and where the public sector is leading the charge to create a better America. “Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people,” the president said. “An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high- paying jobs.” This is standard State of the Union boilerplate, but then the president ticked off many ways the federal government will accomplish this -- through programs to retrain employees, subsidies to the green and automotive industries, grand infrastructure-building programs and through a new federally directed “blueprint” to rebuild the manufacturing industries. He said the federal government’s bailout of General Motors Co. and Chrysler was the key to saving the auto industry. In his view, the feds demanded responsibility in exchange for aid, which resulted in a new era of harmonious relations between workers and management. But as Investor’s Business Daily reported, “Obama broke normal bankruptcy procedure when he bailed out GM so his union pals could get special treatment.” Perhaps the speech should be called the State of the Unions, given that Obama’s policies seem designed mainly to protect union workers from reform. President’s Speech “It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts and no cop-outs. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody,” the president said, even as he defended such bailouts, handouts and copouts. He called for a new era of responsibility, yet his aid packages have promoted irresponsibility, as local officials vie for added federal dollars rather than make the hard choices necessary to deal with their debt burdens. The president spoke about underpaid public servants, referring to teachers in particular, but here in California it has been the unsustainable growth in public-sector compensation that most threatens the government programs and infrastructure-building efforts the president says are so necessary to saving our nation. The president sees a starving public sector unable to adequately meet the needs of the public, a world where heroic teachers must dig deeply into their own pockets to pay for school supplies. But public schools are short on cash not because of a lack of taxpayer support, but because of misdirected priorities driven by a lack of competition, bureaucratic inertia and union demands. Obama said we should stop “bashing teachers,” which was a not-so-fair shot directed presumably at Republicans who have battled with those teachers’ unions that are the main obstacle to educational reform. “Of course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid,” the president added. He said that if colleges can’t stop tuition from going up, then funding will go down. He also called on states to make “higher education a higher priority in their budgets.” The president has it backward. Tuition keeps increasing because government aid keeps increasing. Free money keeps educational institutions from making tough choices and using their funds wisely. His misunderstanding of how Other People’s Money drives spending epitomizes the basic misunderstanding at the foundation of his speech and his administration. His point about state education priorities is off the mark. California Schools In California, education is guaranteed by constitutional amendment to receive at least 40 percent of the general-fund budget. Yet the system is a mess, and some of the highest-funded districts are the ones most plagued by corruption and incompetence. Obama should talk to the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles or a former Democratic state senator who leads an education-reform group about obstacles to reform, which revolve around union intransigence and bureaucracy more than funding. Here in California the lush pay and benefit packages that many local officials have secured over the past decade are putting cities deeply in the hole, with compensation to police and firefighters often consuming 70 percent to 80 percent of their budgets. One liberal editorial page quipped that public agencies are becoming pension providers that offer public services on the side. This threat is not just financial. San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, a Democrat, told Vanity Fair that “Our police and firefighters will earn more in retirement than they did when they were working.” He continued, “It’s staggering. When did we go from giving people sick leave to letting them accumulate it and cash it in for hundreds of thousands of dollars when they are done working? There’s a corruption here. It’s not just a financial corruption. It’s a corruption of the attitude of public service.” The president railed against inequality, but doesn’t mention the growing retirement chasm between workers in the public and private sectors. He criticized “bad debt and phony financial profits” but wasn’t speaking of the multibillion- dollar government pension debt or the phony rate-of-return projections used by pension funds to mask the growing debt burden. The president’s reference to greed applied solely to a financial sector that did what its Washington regulators insisted it do: provide home loans to people who couldn’t afford them. I’m assuming his new “Financial Crimes Unit” will spare investigations of the legislators who crafted those rules. And yet the president also said that “responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.” The president is right that it’s time for an economy based on responsibility, but he’s wrong to believe we’ll ever achieve that as long as his administration promotes more bailouts and protects the public sector from accountability.

{"headline": "OpenTable Shares Signaling Anxiety Over New Competitors: Retail", "article": "OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) , the restaurant- reservation service that went public during the worst of the recession and saw its market value triple by the end of 2010, is reeling as investors lose their appetite for the stock. The company’s shares have tumbled 67 percent from a record $115.62 in April amid a continued slow economy, a sluggish effort to enter the European market, and domestic competition from newer, cheaper services such as Livebookings Ltd. Google Inc., which recently purchased restaurant guide Zagat Survey LLC, is also casting a shadow over OpenTable’s shares. “Expectations have come down materially,” said Clayton Moran , a Delray Beach , Florida-based analyst at Benchmark Co. who has a hold rating on the shares. “Growth has now decelerated, and you’ve had these added competitive concerns.” Shares of San Francisco-based OpenTable, which went public in May 2009 at $20, trade at 46 times earnings, even after the stock’s recent declines. That’s a higher valuation than 96 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are at an especially “lofty” valuation considering that the company hasn’t yet proved it has a plan to maintain its market leadership, said Justin Patterson, an analyst at Morgan Keegan & Co. in Nashville, Tennessee. Online Reservation Market The company dominates the market for reservations in the U.S., with more than 16,000 restaurant subscribers, and may reach 20,000 in 2012, Moran said. Eatery owners pay for OpenTable ’s computer system, which lets them manage table inventory and maintain a profile of customers who have dined there, on top of other fees. Those owners include A.J. Gilbert, who runs San Francisco ’s Luna Park , a restaurant serving modern American food that costs about $20 for a dinner entree. He estimates that OpenTable brings in about 60 percent of his restaurant’s reservations. Those bookings come at a price. Gilbert paid $2,351 on his last monthly OpenTable bill. “The market is ready for some price competition,” he said. “OpenTable has kind of stumbled into this monopoly. They support their product really well. They’re just really expensive.” Well, not really, according to Matthew Roberts, chief executive officer of OpenTable. For every $1 OpenTable charged in fees for logged reservations, diners spent an average of $43 in North America last year, he said. Considering Alternatives That argument is hard to make to restaurants trying to shave costs in challenging economic times. One alternative may be Livebookings , Europe’s largest online restaurant-reservation provider, which started a free service in the U.S. last month that lets restaurants enable online reservations on their own websites and Facebook pages. OpenTable estimates it has signed up 64 percent of reservation-taking restaurants in San Francisco. The company may be hitting a wall in pushing beyond that level in the city, as well as in its other key markets such as New York , Washington and Chicago , Patterson said. Roberts disagrees. “We’re not seeing that we’re running into any kind of wall relative to growth,” he said last month on Bloomberg Television. The company estimates it has signed on 37 percent of the 35,000 reservation-taking restaurants it has identified as its potential market in North America. The Google Question The question is, what will Google do? Its September takeover (GOOG) of Zagat , the review service known for its burgundy- colored restaurant guides, has already contributed to OpenTable’s share price decline. If Google decides to use Zagat to start a restaurant-booking service, OpenTable would face competition from the world’s largest Internet-search provider. As it stands now, the company benefits from Google. In August, OpenTable said that 5 percent to 10 percent of traffic on its site comes from Mountain View , California-based Google and other affiliates, including Zagat and Yelp Inc. “If we were to get any sense that Google was going to remove the uncertainty of it potentially doing reservations directly, it would help the stock,” Moran said. In the meantime, a sluggish economy isn’t helping OpenTable’s prospects. An unemployment rate hovering around 8.6 percent means people may choose to dine out less, weighing on revenue. Last year, 48 percent of OpenTable’s sales came from fees it charged restaurants for seating each individual diner. The company increased revenue just 1.7 percent in this year’s second quarter from the prior period, and sales were also little changed sequentially in the third quarter. Revenue will rise 7 percent to $36.7 million in the last three months of this year compared with the third quarter, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, OpenTable sales jumped 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the previous period. New Cities The company needs to find new business in cities such as Dallas where it hasn’t yet established itself, Patterson said. International expansion has also taken longer than expected, Moran said. The company hasn’t identified what the next growth driver will be if the effort doesn’t turn around, he said. Livebookings is its largest rival, with about 9,000 restaurant subscribers, mostly in Europe , while OpenTable logged 7,629 in its international markets, including Germany , Japan and the U.K., in the third quarter. OpenTable bought its way into the European market in 2010 with the acquisition of Toptable.com, a restaurant-reservation service then based in London , for $55 million. The company is making Toptable’s website more user-friendly and expects it to start generating more growth in the U.K. in the second half of 2012, Roberts said. “There’s nothing that we’ve learned that indicates London should be any different than Manhattan or San Francisco,” Roberts said in an interview.

{"headline": "Wheat Rises as Rain to Curb Russian, Ukraine Output; Corn Gains", "article": "Wheat futures rose for the fourth time in five sessions on speculation that wet weather will curtail production in Russia and Ukraine, boosting demand for U.S. supplies. Corn also climbed, while soybeans fell. Russia may plant 13 million hectares of grain for harvest next year, down from 16 million expected earlier, Nikolai Fedorov, the agriculture minister said at a news conference today. Ukraine winter-wheat planting may be 30 percent less than targeted after record rainfall, the national weather center in Kiev said Sept. 27. “The drop in planted area in Russia and Ukraine will continue to provide support for the market,” Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for Jefferies Bache LLC in Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “A further rally in prices may begin to slow demand.” Wheat futures for delivery in December increased 0.9 percent to $6.9325 a bushel at 10:11 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last week, the grain rose 0.6 percent, the third straight gain and the longest rally in a year, after the government said U.S. inventories on Sept. 1 fell to the lowest in six years. Corn futures for delivery in December added 0.7 percent to $4.465 a bushel in Chicago, heading for a third straight gain. Soybean futures for delivery in November slipped 0.2 percent to $12.93 a bushel on the CBOT, after rising as much as 0.8 percent. Informa Economics Inc. in Memphis , Tennessee , cut its soybean harvest forecast last week by 1.5 percent to 3.176 billion bushels, partly as crop conditions fell. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicted 3.161 billion, more than the USDA’s estimate last month of 3.149 billion. The USDA’s scheduled update of estimates on Oct. 11 may be delayed by the federal government’s partial shutdown that began Oct. 1.

{"headline": "Sydney Opera House Luxury-Home Auction Hurt by Rate Increase", "article": "A luxury home auction at the Sydney Opera House yesterday managed to sell only two of the 11 Australian homes on offer as the most aggressive round of interest rate increases by a Group of 20 member saps demand. The auction, in a housing market the International Monetary Fund said may be overvalued by as much as 15 percent, raised A$4.11 million ($4.15 million), a fraction of the A$30 million of properties on sale. They included 10 homes in New South Wales, five of which were in Sydney, and one in Brisbane, and were valued at A$2 million to A$10 million each, according to Ray White, the biggest property broker in Australia and New Zealand. “House prices have been going sideways since June,” said Alan Oster , chief economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “You’ve got interest rates that are going up and have further to go, and that’s not helping.” The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75 percent on Nov. 2 and said it welcomed a cooling of house prices, even as home- price growth slowed for a third straight quarter from July to September. Auction clearance rates averaged 54.7 percent across Australia’s eight capital cities during the Nov. 5 weekend, compared with an average of 63.8 percent the weekend of May 29, according to data from real estate research group RP Data. Home values in the top 20 percent of Australian suburbs by price fell 2 percent in the three months to July, compared with declines of less than 0.7 percent for the rest of the market, according to an RP Data-Rismark index. Rates hit Last week, “the Reserve Bank seemed to give the indication that they were keen to keep the lid on prices, and that’s not what buyers want to hear,” Brian White , chairman of the Ray White Group , which organized the event, said in an interview after the auction. “That’s a very bearish sentiment.” With Sydney’s median home price at A$506,000 in the three months to September, according to RP Data, even buyers of properties in the low millions could be susceptible to rising interest rates, White and Oster said. Ray White is in talks with potential buyers and expects to sell three more of the properties in “the next couple of days,” White said. He said he had hoped to sell at least five houses during the auction. More than 100 people turned up to the event, the first Ray White auction to be held at the Opera House, which was marketed both domestically and internationally. About 20 were registered bidders, according to Chief Auctioneer Sam Kelso. Brisk Start After a brisk start -- with two parties almost doubling the opening price to A$1.56 million for a country home in Mittagong in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales -- the next seven properties either received low offers or none at all. The other successful offer was a A$2.55 million bid for a riverfront development in Birdwood, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Sydney. Some properties -- including a six-bedroom rural lakefront home with a tennis court, billiards room, pool and sauna in Tuncurry, about 300 kilometers north of Sydney, and a three- level home with under-floor heating and a 12-person lift in Blakehurst, a south Sydney suburb -- failed to receive any bids. Sellers Disappointed Others, such as a seven-acre, five-bedroom estate in Belrose, in Sydney’s northern beaches, and the five- bedroom Brisbane penthouse apartment that included full butler’s quarters and three outdoor entertaining areas, received bids that didn’t meet the owners’ expectations. The only offer for the Belrose property was A$3.4 million, A$500,000 below the owner’s price, and the highest bid for the Brisbane apartment was A$3.5 million, missing the seller’s A$4.3 million expectation. The broker expects more interest in the remaining properties in the coming month, White said. The company plans to hold similar auctions each November and March. More sellers are now putting prime properties up for sale than at the start of the year, according to Ray White. “With the top end of the market toughening a little bit, we wanted to offer our top-end clients a point of difference,” Kelso said in a telephone interview on Nov. 5. Luxury properties are taking longer to sell and about 25 percent fewer homes are changing hands than 18 months ago, though there is still demand, Bill Malouf, principal at real- estate chain LJ Hooker in the eastern Sydney suburb of Double Bay, said last month. Acute Shortage An “acute” housing shortage, credit constraints and income growth will keep Australian home prices from falling, Westpac Banking Corp. said on Oct. 28, joining Commonwealth Bank of Australia in refuting speculation about a bubble. Preliminary results of a stress test on mortgages by Fitch Ratings found banks could handle an unlikely worst-case loan default scenario. Bidders based in Singapore, China and Indonesia expressed interest in the properties following Ray White’s marketing campaign in Asia, White said yesterday. Johann Boyke Nurtanio, who works for Ray White in Indonesia and attended the auction, said he’s on the lookout for properties in Australia priced at A$500,000 to A$2 million for clients whose children are considering attending university in the country. Ray White isn’t the only group trying to draw overseas buyers, even after a change in rules by the federal government in April made it more difficult for foreigners to invest in Australian properties. Colliers International is holding a property exhibition in Hong Kong to market its new Dominion residential estate in Darlinghurst, an inner suburb of Sydney, on Nov. 13 and 14.

{"headline": "Egyptian Stocks Retreat to Lowest in a Month on Deadly Clashes", "article": "Egyptian stocks dropped to the lowest in a month after security forces and protesters clashed for a fifth day in central Cairo and the government removed subsidies on energy-intensive industries. Commercial International Bank (COMI) , the biggest publicly traded bank in Egypt, retreated to the lowest since May 2009 and Orascom Construction Industries lost 1.8 percent. The EGX 30 Index (EGX30) dropped 2.5 percent to 3,706.3, the lowest since Nov. 22, at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo as 28 stocks fell and two were unchanged. The measure has tumbled 48 percent this year, making it the third-worst performer globally after Cyprus and Greece. Soldiers and police stormed Tahrir Square injuring dozens, according to demonstrators who pointed to bloodstains on their clothes and the tarmac. Hisham Sheeha, a health ministry official, said 28 people were injured today and 12 have died since Dec. 16. The clashes are the latest between protesters demanding an immediate end to military rule and the generals who took interim power after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. “Ongoing violence, the lack of a catalyst and the lifting of subsidies on energy intensive industries” is weighing on stocks, said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage. Egypt will lift subsidies on energy-intensive industries, Planning and International Co-operation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga said yesterday, without giving a time frame.

{"headline": "RBS Loss Wider Than Estimated on Greece, Compensation", "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s biggest state-owned lender, reported a wider-than- estimated loss on impairments in Ireland, writing down Greek debt and compensating customers for improperly sold insurance. The net loss for 2011 was 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) compared with 1.1 billion pounds a year earlier, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets said in a statement today. That was worse than the 1.1 billion-pound median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. RBS took an impairment of 1.1 billion pounds on holdings of Greek government securities and said it “exceeded run-off targets” in its non-core businesses, bringing forward some of its losses. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester , 51, who has said his job is equivalent to defusing the “biggest time bomb in history,” has shrunk the bank’s assets by more than 700 billion pounds and cut more than 35,000 jobs since he took over from Fred Goodwin in 2008. “While there is still work to be done to get RBS into a position where it is generating attractive returns for shareholders, the glide path to normality is increasingly clear,” UBS AG analysts John-Paul Crutchley and Alastair Ryan said in an e-mailed note. RBS’s loss would have been narrower if it hadn’t taken 850 million pounds in charges relating to compensation for U.K. customers who were improperly sold personal-loan insurance. Shares Rise The loss at RBS’s Irish unit, Ulster Bank Ltd., increased to 1.02 billion pounds in 2011 from 760 million pounds in the previous year on impaired mortgages. RBS has injected as much as 10 billion pounds into its Irish unit since 2008. The lender reduced its medium-term target for return on equity to 12 percent from 15 percent. “We have three jobs at RBS -- to support our customers, to defuse our legacy risks and rebuild a successful, profitable bank,” Hester said in the statement. “In 2011 we showed results across all three goals, though with much still to do.” Shares of RBS rose 5.1 percent to 28.72 pence at the close in London, compared with a 0.7 percent loss by the Bloomberg Europe Banks Index. After sinking 48 percent last year, the stock has rebounded 42 percent this year. By contrast, shares (RBS) of Commerzbank AG and Credit Agricole SA, which also reported earnings hurt by Greek writedowns today, both declined. ‘Enormous Progress’ “The management team have clearly made enormous progress and the market recognizes that,” said Christopher Wheeler , a banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA with a “neutral” rating on the stock. “However, RBS is still dogged by some serious issues, such as Ulster Bank.” Operating profit at the bank’s consumer unit rose 45 percent to 1.99 billion pounds last year, while operating profit at the corporate unit slid 3.3 percent, RBS said. RBS’s results were also affected by rising borrowing costs as the bank weans itself off low-interest government loans and takes on costlier funding in wholesale markets. The bank opted in December to go the European Central Bank for an emergency 5 billion euro loan as its own costs of borrowing reached an unsustainable level, a person familiar with the matter said. The U.K. rescued RBS at the height of the financial crisis, injecting 45.5 billion pounds of taxpayer money into the lender, making it the costliest bailout of any bank. Banker Pay RBS’s compensation ratio, a measure of pay against revenue, rose to 41 percent compared with 34 percent for 2010. The bank’s bonus pool fell 21 percent to 985 million pounds, and total salaries fell 1 percent to 5.42 billion pounds. “We have aligned the longer-term rewards our people receive with our shareholders’ interests,” RBS Chairman Philip Hampton said in a letter to shareholders. “We have led the way in changing how we pay our people.” Hampton and Hester last month relinquished their bonuses for 2011 amid a storm on the issue in the U.K. media. The investment-banking unit set aside 390 million pounds of bonus, including cash, shares and deferred awards, a 58 percent drop from the year earlier, and an average of 22,941 pounds per worker. Operating profit at the investment bank slid 54 percent to 1.6 billion in 2011 compared with the previous year. RBS paid employees at its securities business an average of about 112,000 pounds each including salary, bonus and pension, spokeswoman Linda Harper said by phone today, down from 152,000 pounds last year. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said last month banks must show “proper regard” in limiting bonuses. “What needs to happen is a sense of restraint,” Cameron told reporters in Brussels after a meeting of European leaders. “They need to do a better job of demonstrating how pay is related to performance.

{"headline": "DiDonato Elopes to Vegas, Rages Against Arts Cuts: Interview", "article": "Although mezzo Joyce DiDonato swings both ways, operatically speaking, now even she has a juicy new opportunity for gender bending. “This is the first opera I’ve sung where I play the girl instead of the guy in the all-female love duets,” she says. “It’s really sweet.” London ’s Royal Opera House is staging Massenet’s 1899 opera “Cendrillon,” based on the story of Cinderella, as a star vehicle for the Kansas-born singer. The title role needs a mezzo with a rich middle register, soaring high notes and great acting skills, all of which she has in spades. When I catch up with DiDonato, 42, at Covent Garden, my first question is not about fairy tales. It’s about her leg. She last appeared at the Royal Opera as Rosina in Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville,” and broke her shin on opening night. Hardy trooper that she is, she finished the run in a wheelchair. Is she fully recovered now? “Yes, everything’s fine,” she says, twirling her toes to prove it. “Though you know what? About eight months after that first accident, I tripped on stage again and tore all the ligaments in the same foot. The expletives were pouring out of my mouth then, I can tell you.” A date with the surgeon’s knife in Geneva sorted her out. “I didn’t make a big deal of it at the time. I felt, ‘Enough with the foot story already.’ And now everything’s fine.” Superb Prince There are happier memories attached to “Cendrillon.” She first sang the role when Laurent Pelly’s staging premiered in Santa Fe, New Mexico , in 2006. “That was one of my top two or three favorite productions of all time,” DiDonato says. “When the Royal Opera asked me if there was anything I’d like to sing, I suggested this.” It was a good choice. Pelly’s charming staging has some amusing costumes and a sprinkle of fairy-tale magic about it. DiDonato is terrific in the title role, and she has a superb Prince Charming in Alice Coote. There are other reasons why she recalls it fondly. “I married my husband during that run in 2006,” DiDonato says. “We took off to Las Vegas one weekend without telling anybody, and came back married. You could say we eloped.” Her husband Leonardo Vordoni is an Italian musician who, in a twist of fate, is now in Santa Fe himself conducting a production of Puccini’s “La Boheme.” “So Santa Fe is a lot in my thoughts at the moment,” she says. Has marriage changed her? “It’s wonderful to be with someone in the business, who understands the pressures of performing,” she says. “We coordinate our schedules to be able to spend as much time as possible together.” Kansas Cuts Kansas is as much on her mind as New Mexico. Sam Brownback , the Republican governor of DiDonato’s home state, recently erased all state arts funding. The matching federal arts funding was thus withdrawn too. DiDonato wrote an angry blog about it in which she argued what a positive cultural and financial impact the arts have on life. It was picked up and printed by two newspapers, and cause much comment. Has it made a difference, I ask her? “I haven’t a clue,” she says. “I’m just happy I spoke my mind. I understand that cuts are necessary across the board, but he singlehandedly eliminated every single penny for the arts. It’s so misguided, so shortsighted. Staying silent wasn’t an option for me.” DiDonato’s keen to use her high profile to highlight issues she cares about. She also uses her privileged access to the great and good of opera in other ways. Her hobby is photography, and she often takes shots of her colleagues during rehearsals. Her pictures of soprano Diana Damrau rehearsing in “Le Comte Ory” at the Met, taken from the wings, have snap and crackle. On her Flickr photosharing page (details below), there are lively rehearsal shots of “Cendrillon.” Dior Bag At the moment, it’s opera -- not photography -- that brings in her A-list earnings. What does she do with her fees? “I splurge on holidays, and the rest of the time I save,” says DiDonato. No diva-like impulse buying of glamorous frocks? “I had a busy season a while ago in Milan, and picked up a few extra fees,” she says. “So I decided to be a diva for a change. I’ve never paid more than about $40 for a handbag, so I thought I’d treat myself to something fashionable in Milan.” DiDonato went to the Dior shop, and found a gorgeous purse. “When the assistant told me it was 2,600 euros ($3,647), I froze. ‘I could send someone to college for that,’ I gasped. I just couldn’t buy it.” She hoots with laughter, “Honey, I am so from Kansas !” Joyce DiDonato performs in “Cendrillon” in repertory through July 16 at the Royal Opera.

Asked if bondholders might face a loss of more than 21 percent, Juncker said: “One can’t say that at the moment. We’re in the process of having discussions at all levels, also with the IIF.

{"headline": "Woman Vintner Puts Rhone Valley Jaboulet Back on Map", "article": "French winemaker Caroline Frey, in chic white jacket over a sparkly T-shirt and slim velvet pants, hardly looks like a fighter. Still, she was ready to block roads to prevent construction of a massive TV tower on the Rhone Valley’s most famous vineyard spot and source of her best wine, the hill of Hermitage. Her efforts, along with other winemakers, paid off: in June, it received protected status. Frey’s tougher job has been resurrecting the reputation of wines from the venerable Rhone firm Domaines Paul Jaboulet Aine. When her father, real estate entrepreneur Jean-Jacques Frey, purchased the wine company in 2006, quality was inconsistent, even for flagship Hermitage La Chapelle, one of the world’s legendary reds, and the Jaboulet brand had lost its cachet. My recent tastings, however, suggest that 35-year-old Frey, born in Champagne , trained in Bordeaux, and winemaker at her family’s Chateau La Lagune , is beginning to turn the Jaboulet wines around. It helped that 2009 and 2010 were stellar vintages in the Northern Rhone, where the red grape is syrah and whites are marsanne, roussanne, and viognier. The Jaboulet family’s Rhone history dates back to 1834. For much of the 20th century, it was the most important negociant and producer there, with 280 acres (113 hectares) of vines, including 52 acres in Hermitage. Pouring Money After taking over, the Freys poured in money, just as they did after purchasing Chateau La Lagune in 2000. “First I stopped pesticides and herbicides and began plowing with horses to allow the vine roots to go deep in the soil,” explains Frey, pulling out bottles for tasting at Vinexpo in Bordeaux. As proprietor, she has created new domaine wines from Jaboulet vineyards, built a new winery, and revived Hermitage La Chapelle white. Defunct since 1962, this rarity seems aimed at collectors. Drastic sorting and selection, Frey says, also upped quality. Only 2,000 cases of 2009 Hermitage La Chapelle were bottled, compared to nearly 9,000 cases in 2000. Some of the 30-plus wines are works in progress. I never liked the winery’s boring Parallele 45 red, white, and rose ($10), and still don’t. The 2011 Domaine Mule Blanche Crozes Hermitage Blanc ($40), a tart, citrusy marsanne-roussanne blend, lacks personality. Orange Rind I preferred the full, lush 2011 Domaine des Grands Amandiers Condrieu ($78), made from viognier, with its notes of minerals, orange rind and white flowers. The best red value, despite a 30 percent price rise last year, is the glossy Domaine de Thalabert Crozes Hermitage ($52), made from 60-year-old vines. The 2010 is all pepper, licorice and spice; the 2011 is round and luscious with smoky, savory fruit. I also like the inky, powerful, almost beefy 2011 Domaine de Saint-Pierre Cornas ($100) from a four-hectare parcel of 40-year-old vines. The star, Hermitage La Chapelle, is back on track, though it now faces tough competition from other producers such as Jean-Louis Chave, whose brilliant Hermitage red and white have a cult following. The Jaboulet wine is named for the 13th-century stone chapel built, according to legend, by a wounded knight back from the Crusades seeking a peaceful refuge. Czar Fan Louis XIII boosted the fame of Hermitage wines in his court. The Russian Romanovs, including Czar Nicholas II, were fans. And great 19th-century Bordeaux were “hermitaged” -- mixed with Rhone wine to give them color and body. Unlike some producers, Jaboulet blends together grapes from granite and limestone plots for La Chapelle. The ripe, deep 2009 ($200) was the turn-around vintage, while the dense, luscious, smoky 2010 ($240), with its suede texture and taste of candied violets, is a step up. The smooth, blackberry-and-licorice 2011 ($140 as futures), to be released in January, will be ready to drink much sooner than the 2009 and 2010. While a few critics suggest the Jaboulet wines haven’t yet established a style, I see a definite vision at work. Frey is aiming for wines that are pure, balanced and not theatrical or high in alcohol. Liv-Ex’s September Market Report shows increased interest in both Northern and Southern Rhone wines last month. Auction Demand Auction demand for Northern Rhone wines is tightly focused on the very best Cote-Rotie and Hermitage wines from top producers such as Chave, E. Guigal, and Jaboulet, says Jamie Ritchie, chief executive officer and President of Sotheby’s (BID) Wine for the Americas and Asia. One way Frey has drawn more international attention is by offering bottles of Hermitage La Chapelle direct from the Jaboulet cellars at Sotheby’s auctions. On Saturday, Sept. 7 , in Hong Kong , the New York auction house held its third successful Jaboulet sale, with vintages spanning 1949 to 2010. A private Asian bidder paid $94,231 for six bottles of the 1961, nearly double the high estimate. Still, that wasn’t quite as high as the price paid for the 1961 at Sotheby’s Hong Kong sale last December, when, after enthusiastic bidding, three bottles brought $22,000 each, 165 percent above estimate. That works out to about $3,666 per four-ounce glass. I’ve sipped this velvety red on only three occasions, and it was one of the best wines I’d ever tasted, up there with 1945 Mouton Rothschild. Other top vintages are 1978 and 1990. Whether 2010 is in their league remains to be seen. “I think there’s a big difference between the quality of Jaboulet wines today and the perception of them,” Frey says. “It takes years to change opinions. That’s so frustrating.” (Elin McCoy writes on wine and spirits for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are her own.)

{"headline": "Japan Securities Watchdog Files Complaint in Wal-Mart Unit's Trading Case", "article": "Japan’s securities watchdog said it filed a complaint with prosecutors over possible insider trading by the husband of a former board member of Seiyu GK , the local unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The man and his company bought 268,000 shares of Tokyo- based Seiyu for 23.4 million yen ($280,000) between Oct. 2 and Oct. 19, 2007, after hearing from his wife that Wal-Mart was about to take over the supermarket chain, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission said yesterday.

The stock traded at an average of 90 yen when the purchases took place, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart announced its plan on Oct. 22, 2007, to pay 140 yen a share to take full ownership of Seiyu. “We’re fully cooperating with authorities for their investigation,” Kumie Wama, a Seiyu spokeswoman, said by telephone. “We decline to comment further.” To contact the reporter on this story: Naoko Fujimura in Tokyo at  nfujimura@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Longid at  flongid@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "내부자 거래란 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "내부자 거래가 시장에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "내부자 거래를 방지하기 위한 규제와 정책은 어떻게 설계되어야 할까요?"}]}
{"headline": "Brazil Rate-Futures Yields Fall to Record on Shrinking Industry", "article": "Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts dropped to a record low on speculation the central bank will deepen cuts in borrowing costs after a report showed industrial production fell more than economists forecast. Yields on the futures contract due in January 2014 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.82 percent in Sao Paulo after touching a record low 7.79 percent. The real snapped a two-day gain, depreciating 1.5 percent to 2.0155 per U.S. dollar , the biggest loss in almost two weeks. Output declined 0.9 percent in May from a month earlier, the national statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro. Economists had expected a decline of 0.6 percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 40 analysts. “The industrial sector is what suffers most from the global deceleration, which the market should be interpreting as a possibility for more stimulus,” Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento , said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. The real rallied yesterday to a level stronger than 2 per dollar for the first time in a month after the central bank supported it with currency swap auctions three times last week. The bank has sold the swaps on 11 days since May 18 for $16.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The swaps are a reversal of the bank’s dollar purchases, which increased to $7.2 billion in April, the most in 13 months, to weaken the currency and support the country’s exporters. The bank abandoned those purchases in May. ‘Surprised Again’ “We could be surprised again by the central bank,” Italo Abucater, head of currency trading at Icap do Brasil CTVM, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “If the real rises above 1.95 per dollar, we could see the bank buying dollars again.” Brazil ’s gross domestic product expanded 2.7 percent in 2011, down from growth of 7.5 percent in 2010. Analysts surveyed by the central bank reduced their 2012 growth forecast for an eighth week to 2.05 percent, a report showed yesterday. The central bank has cut its target lending rate by 4 percentage points since August, the most among Group of 20 nations, to a record low of 8.5 percent. Traders are betting policy makers will reduce the benchmark to 7.75 percent by the end of next month, interest-rate futures yields indicate.

{"headline": "U.S. Federal Reserve Beige Book: Dallas District (Text)", "article": "The following is the text of the Federal Reserve Board’s eleventh District-- Dallas. ELEVENTH DISTRICT--DALLAS The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace over the past six weeks. Overall manufacturing activity continued to expand. Demand for business services remained solid, and transportation services activity increased. Respondents said retail sales grew at a somewhat slower pace than the last report, and automobile sales held steady. The housing sector continued to improve, and commercial real estate leasing activity held steady. Financial firms noted mixed loan demand. Overall energy activity remained strong, although gas-directed drilling continued to decline. Agricultural conditions deteriorated slightly. Employment levels were steady to slightly higher, and prices were mostly unchanged. Wage pressures remained minimal. Outlooks across industries were generally positive, but some respondents expressed concern about European debt issues, U.S. political uncertainty, and healthcare costs. Prices Most responding firms said prices were unchanged from the last reporting period. However, accounting firms noted a modest rise in rates, airlines reported higher fares, and some construction- related manufacturers said they were able to raise selling prices as a result of improved demand. Overall, input costs were flat to down, with reports of lower prices for cotton, scrap metal, and steel. The recent decline in fuel prices lowered costs for airlines and freight transportation firms. The price of WTI ranged from around $83 per barrel in early June to near $85 in early July. Natural gas prices remained depressed but rose 50 cents to around $2.85 per thousand cubic feet over the same period. The price of gasoline declined about 40 cents over the reporting period. Prices for several petrochemical products fell sharply due in part to softening global demand. Labor Market Most responding firms said employment levels were flat to up slightly. Staffing firms reported demand remained steady at very high levels and noted rising demand for financial analysts, steel and metal fabricators, and construction workers. Reports of hiring came from some retailers, automobile dealers, and primary metals, lumber, paper, and food manufacturers. Wage pressures remained minimal, although legal contacts said raises and bonuses had improved, and rising wages were noted for manufacturing workers with specialized skills such as machine operators. Manufacturing Overall demand for construction-related products held steady since the last report, and respondents’ outlooks have become slightly more guarded. Producers of stone, clay, and glass reported improved demand and higher capacity utilization rates compared to earlier in the year. Contacts in the lumber industry noted a pickup in demand, while primary metals manufacturers reported slight declines. Producers of fabricated metals reported steady sales activity, but said they were concerned about the continuity of some private projects. Conditions weakened in the high-tech manufacturing sector since the last report. Most respondents said growth in orders slowed or remained flat largely due to a weakening global economy and more uncertainty in outlooks. Contacts said that inventories were close to desired levels and that employment levels were stable. High-tech manufacturers expect growth to remain flat or weaken slightly--a change from earlier in the year when most contacts expected a pickup in the second half. Demand for paper products held steady, and contacts said they expect modest sales growth for the year. Food producers said sales activity increased over the past six weeks and orders were up significantly from year-ago levels. One food manufacturer reported adding several new workers in part due to strong demand. Automobile and aviation equipment manufacturers said demand held steady since the last report. Expectations are for seasonal pickup in automobile sales over the summer, but aviation manufacturers expect sales to remain flat. Petrochemicals producers reported a sharp decline in prices due to softening global demand, lower feedstock prices, and capacity coming back online following unplanned outages earlier in the year. Still, margins have remained relatively healthy for ethylene and polyethylene producers. Domestic demand for PVC, tied to residential construction, strengthened, and exports continued to be a major source of sales. Contacts noted inventories of gasoline and distillates were below normal, and Gulf Coast refineries were operating at rates above 90 percent in order to catch up. Retail Sales Retail sales increased but the pace of growth decelerated slightly compared to earlier in the year. Sales of apparel, bedding, household items, and small furniture fared well. Discount retailers said sales of food and sundries continued to perform the strongest. Overall sales growth in the Eleventh District continued to outpace the nation, on average, according to three large retailers. Outlooks are cautiously optimistic and contacts say it appears as if the environment has improved slightly for the consumer. Automobile sales continued to grow at a steady pace. Inventories were at desired levels and prices remained stable. Auto dealers expect sales growth to continue at the same pace through year end. Services Demand for staffing services remained steady at very high levels, and contacts noted an increase in orders for financial analysts, construction workers, and steel and metal fabricators. Outlooks were mostly positive but slightly more cautious than the last report. Accounting firms noted a seasonal slowdown in demand. Demand for energy and audit-related services increased modestly while advisory, transactional, and tax services activity softened slightly. Legal firms reported a pickup in demand, with continued strength in real estate, intellectual property, energy, and tax-related services. Reports from transportation service firms were positive. Railroads noted a slight increase in shipments, with particularly strong growth in petroleum products, motor vehicles and equipment, crushed stone, and metals. Air cargo, container, and small parcel shipments increased modestly during the reporting period. Airlines reported stable passenger demand over the past six weeks. Domestic demand remained strong buoyed by both corporate and leisure travel. Demand for international travel was strongest for travel to South America and Mexico. Airlines expect passenger demand to soften in the fall and ramp back up over the holiday season. Construction and Real Estate Contacts in the single-family housing industry said demand picked up over the past six weeks. Respondents noted that demand was outstripping supply in some areas, leading to falling inventories. Construction activity was picking up as result. Realtors and builders remained cautiously optimistic. Apartment market respondents continued to report solid demand. While rental rates continued to rise, the pace slowed slightly. Apartment construction activity is expected to pick up in coming months. Commercial real estate leasing activity remained steady since the last report. Energy and technology sectors continue to drive demand for space, particularly in Houston. Contacts were optimistic but remained concerned about the pace of U.S. economic activity. Financial Services Overall, financial firms reported mixed loan demand. National banks said middle-market lending declined, while auto and energy lending activity remained positive. Regional and community banks noted improvement in C&I and commercial real estate lending. Consumer lending appeared to be steady, with strong mortgage demand and a healthy backlog of loans in the pipeline. Loan pricing remained competitive at very low rates. The quality of outstanding loans continued to improve slowly and deposit growth was mixed. Outlooks are slightly more pessimistic than the last report in part due to European debt issues and regulatory and political uncertainty. Energy Respondents at energy-related firms said activity remained strong, and the District rig count grew modestly over the past six weeks. The rapid shift from dry-gas drilling to oil-directed drilling has not reduced the overall pace of activity, and business remains strong with long lead times and growing backlogs. Activity in the Gulf of Mexico increased further, and the success of a recent auction of offshore acreage suggests continued interest in the region. Agriculture Agricultural conditions deteriorated slightly due to hot and dry weather. Planting neared completion and crops were mostly in fair to good shape, with conditions much better than a year ago. Since the last report, livestock producers have seen pastures dry out, cattle prices fall, and feed costs increase. Crop prices generally increased over the past six weeks, particularly for corn, although cotton prices fell sharply.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "연방준비제도(Fed)의 11번 지구(Dallas) 경제는 지난 6주간 어떤 성장세를 보였나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "텍사스 지역의 건설 관련 제품 수요는 지난 보고서 이후 어떻게 변화했으며, 전망은 어떻게 되나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "텍사스 지역의 농업 부문은 최근 어떤 환경 변화에 직면했으며, 이러한 변화가 생산자들에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?"}]}

{"headline": "Swaps Show Treasury Auctions Limit Fed Buying Impact, Deutsche Bank Says", "article": "Movements in interest-rate swaps show government debt auctions diminish the impact Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities have on government debt yields, according to Deutsche Bank AG. Rallies in the swap rate matching the maturities of the debt the Fed was buying were an average of 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, in the two days before the central bank’s scheduled purchase when there were no note or bond auctions, compared with 2 basis points for all of the instances that the Fed purchased debt, Deutsche Bank analysts led by London-based Francis Yared said in a report released Sept. 24. The rallies reverse course after the purchases, wrote the analysts, who studied 25 buyback operations from March 25 to June 8 in 2009 excluding two operations involving inflation- linked debt. The Fed will buy inflation-indexed debt tomorrow maturing from January 2011 to February 2040, while the Treasury will sell $35 billion in five-year notes. “ Buyback operations should be expected to have a greater impact when there is no contemporaneous supply pressure, the analysts wrote. “When there is issuance, the concession pricing” dominates the movement of yields, they wrote. The Fed completed a program of quantitative easing in March, purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. The central bank was the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009. The central bank said on Aug. 10 that it would reinvest the proceeds of maturing mortgage securities in Treasuries in order to maintain its securities holdings at $2 trillion to prevent money from draining out of the financial system. The Fed has bought $34.062 billion of Treasuries since Aug. 17. Fed ‘Accommodation’ The Fed said on Sept. 21 that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation if needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.” The difference between the rate to exchange floating- for fixed-interest payments for 10 years and the comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap spread, decreased 0.25 basis point to 3.25 basis points at 4:02 p.m. in New York The two-year spread narrowed 0.6 basis point to 18.25 basis points. The 10-year interest-rate swap spread has widened from negative 0.75 basis point on Aug. 9, the day before the Fed announced it would reinvest maturing mortgage proceeds in Treasuries. The yield on 10-year notes has fallen 31 basis points to 2.51 percent during that period. The first round of quantitative easing lowered the 10-year yield from 50 to 60 basis points since November 2008, said Joseph Gagnon , a former Fed official who is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, in an interview. He estimated that a second round would “likely be at least $1 trillion” and have a smaller market reaction.

{"headline": "Airbus Works on Final U.S. Air Force Tanker Bid, Claiming Edge on Boeing", "article": "Airbus Military said it’s working on a final bid in the $35 billion U.S. Air Force airborne tanker contest as it seeks to trump Boeing Co. in a delayed competition that has already spanned nine years. Airbus’s defense arm is bullish about winning the order because its A330 airliner-based model offers greater capability than Boeing’s 767, Domingo Urena Raso , the unit’s chief executive officer, said in an interview in Toulouse, France. “Our plane is bigger, it has a cabin in which you can do medical evacuation or transport soldiers or ground crews, and it provides more fuel capacity, hence flying further and being able to refuel more fighters,” he said. “You’d otherwise need two or three different aircraft to perform the same types of mission.” Boeing said its bid meets all mandatory requirements and that Airbus’s plane is “oversized.” The Air Force said Nov. 20 it would delay making a choice until early 2011 after mistakenly disclosing both bidders’ data on combat-mission analysis. Urena Raso declined to comment on how the proposals might be affected by the revelations, which didn’t include pricing information. Airbus is still answering final questions about its plane, which would carry 270 troops and ground equipment in addition to fuel, Urena Raso said, and expects the Pentagon to ask for final bids shortly, ahead of an evaluation period to pick the winner. Going Solo The Airbus tanker was originally chosen by the U.S. Air Force over Boeing’s proposal in 2007, only for the award to be quashed after its rival contested the decision. While Airbus and parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. were junior partners to U.S.-based Northrop Grumman Corp. in the initial contest, this time round they’re competing alone. Airbus has already beaten Boeing in bids to supply the U.K. and Australia with refueling planes and can draw on those designs if it wins the U.S. order, Urena Raso said on Dec. 15. It also won contests in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while Boeing was selected in Japan and Italy. A tanker destined for Britain’s Royal Air Force this week made its first contact with a jet fighter using a hose trailing from the rear fuselage to provide a higher fuel flow than wing- mounted gear. That completes tests for every combination of fuelling option, the executive said. Boeing’s 767-based aircraft would burn 24 percent less fuel than the Airbus plane while meeting the Pentagon’s 372 bid requirements, spokesman William Barksdale said in an e-mail. The Chicago-based company’s proposal is based on proven technology from the KC-10 and KC-135 tankers and will also incorporate cockpit displays from the new 787 Dreamliner, he said.

(GOOG) ’s Android extended its lead as the most widely used U.S. smartphone software last quarter, while Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost share, ComScore Inc. said. Android’s share widened to 40.1 percent in the three months that ended in June from 34.7 percent in the first quarter, ComScore said in a statement. That followed a separate report from IDC that showed Apple Inc. (AAPL) was the biggest seller of smartphones worldwide last quarter, with 19.1 percent share of shipments. Apple and Google are vying for leadership in the market for smartphones, which IDC says will rise 55 percent globally this year as more consumers opt for phones that offer swift Web surfing and access to thousands of downloadable applications. While the iPhone is the best-selling handset, Android is more widely used partly because it’s carried by multiple vendors. “Google Android continued to gain ground in the smartphone market,” Reston, Virginia-based ComScore said in a statement. Apple’s iOS software overtook Research In Motion’s BlackBerry operating system for second place, according to ComScore. Apple’s U.S. share advanced to 26.6 percent from 25.5 percent in the prior three months, ComScore said. Research in Motion, Microsoft and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) all lost share. In global smartphone sales, Apple’s iPhone share rose from 13 percent a year earlier, according to IDC research, which was also released today. Samsung Electronics Co.’s share rose to 16.3 percent.

{"headline": "Mexican Peso Drops Most in Three Weeks on Moody’s Europe Review", "article": "Mexico ’s peso dropped the most in three weeks after a report showed industrial production rose less than forecast and Moody’s Investors Service said it will review the ratings of all European Union countries. The peso declined 1.9 percent to 13.8342 per U.S. dollar at 11:54 a.m. in Mexico City, from 13.5744 on Dec. 9. The currency fell 2.1 percent on Nov. 21. Earlier today it tumbled as much as 2.3 percent to 13.8832, the weakest since Nov. 29. Local markets are closed for a national holiday today. Disappointment spread after last week’s summit on the European debt crisis offered few new measures, with all except three of the top 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg declining today. Mexico’s factory output rose 3.3 percent in October from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, trailing the 3.9 percent median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “It’s the global combined with the lack of liquidity because the Mexican market is off,” Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America currency strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said in a telephone interview from Toronto. The weaker-than-forecast industrial production data in Mexico may also have fueled the peso’s decline, according to Suarez. “That should have an impact,” he said. “The numbers had been quite good and this one actually disappointed.” Europe Debt Summit European leaders unveiled a blueprint after meetings on Dec. 8 and 9 for a closer fiscal accord, adding 200 billion euros ($264 billion) to their bailout fund and tightening rules to curb future debts. They also said they would start a 500- billion-euro rescue fund next year. The agreement offered few additional measures and doesn’t diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said in its Weekly Credit Outlook. “Our intention as announced in November is to revisit the level and dispersion of ratings during the first quarter of 2012,” the company said. The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.61 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the security fell 0.24 centavo to 129.52 centavos per peso.

{"headline": "German Inflation Unexpectedly Remained Unchanged in July", "article": "(Corrects to show non-harmonized inflation accelerated in sixth paragraph.) German inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged in July at the highest level in five months. Germany ’s consumer price index , calculated using a harmonized European Union method, rose 1.9 percent from a year ago, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. That exceeds economists’ forecasts for a slowdown to 1.8 percent, according to the median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices increased 0.4 percent from June. “Prices rose a bit more than expected but overall, everything is still under control,” said Heinrich Bayer, an economist at Deutsche Postbank AG (DPB) in Bonn. “The increase is typical for the season, if you keep travel costs in mind. Overall, the price climate is rather calm, without any drivers, except food prices.” Food-price inflation accelerated to 5.7 percent in July from 5.4 percent in June, the statistics office said. Energy costs rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, down from 3 percent in June. The Bundesbank forecasts German inflation will average 1.6 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2014. The Frankfurt-based central bank reduced its 2013 growth projection for Germany last month to 0.3 percent from the 0.4 percent it predicted in December, citing a worse-than-expected first quarter and warned that Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis still poses risks to the economic recovery. Euro-Area Inflation German non-harmonized inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent in July from 1.8 percent, with prices rising 0.5 percent from June. Consumer price gains in the 17-nation euro area accelerated to 1.6 percent in June from 1.4 percent the previous month and 1.2 percent in April as energy prices rebounded, data from the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg showed July 16. Data for this month will be published on July 31. The European Central Bank last month cut its 2013 inflation forecast for the region to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent and left the 2014 estimate unchanged at 1.3 percent. Of 63 economists in a Bloomberg News survey , 62 expect the ECB to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent when policy makers meet this week in Frankfurt. ECB President Mario Draghi pledged on July 4 to keep rates low for an “extended period of time” as the currency bloc tries to emerge from its longest-ever recession. The economy shrank for a sixth quarter in the first three months of this year.

{"headline": "Allstate Has $620 Million Loss, First in Two Years, as Storms Raise Costs", "article": "Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the second-largest U.S. home and auto insurer, posted its first quarterly loss in more than two years as tornadoes led to a surge in claims costs. The stock gained as results beat estimates. The second-quarter net loss of $620 million, or $1.19 a share, compares with profit of $145 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said today in a statement. The operating loss, which excludes some investment results, was $1.23 a share, beating by 35 cents the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Wilson , 53, added auto customers in most states excluding New York and Florida , where the firm has scaled back to boost profitabilty. He’s also raising rates for homeowners’ coverage after storms caused catastrophe costs in the second quarter to balloon to $2.34 billion, an expense the insurer had previously disclosed. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel” if they can reduce their homeowners exposure and increase the number of auto-insurance customers, said Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., in an interview. “There’s a lot of pessimism priced into these shares.” He advises clients to buy the stock. Allstate rose 82 cents, or 3 percent to $28.54 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The insurer had declined 13 percent this year through July 29 while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 2.8 percent. The insurer had been profitable every quarter since reporting a $274 million net loss for the period ended in March 2009. Bank Unit Shuttered The insurer plans to shutter its banking unit after the collapse of a deal to sell deposits to Discover Financial Services, Allstate said today. “We are continuing with plans to wind down the Allstate Bank’s operations and anticipate obtaining regulatory approval to cancel its banking charter by year-end 2011,” Allstate said in a regulatory filing. Catastrophe costs in the second quarter were $2.34 billion, compared with $636 million a year earlier. Allstate lost 23.3 cents for every premium dollar in its property and liability coverage unit compared with a gain of 3.2 cents a year earlier. Using the so-called underlying ratio, which excludes items such as catastrophes, the company made 12.5 cents for every premium dollar in the second quarter. Tornado Damage More than 1,600 tornadoes have been reported this year, compared with 1,282 in all of 2010, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Storms in the U.S. contributed to $14.7 billion in direct insured losses to property in the second quarter, ISO, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc., said in a June 22 statement. Premium revenue in Allstate’s property and liability business fell to $6.46 billion from $6.51 billion a year earlier as the company’s auto and home policy counts declined. Wilson announced a deal in May to purchase Esurance, the online seller of auto coverage, and Answer Financial from White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. for about $1 billion. “The actions we took during the quarter, including our pending acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial, position us well,” Wilson said in today’s statement. The departure last month of Joseph Lacher, president of Allstate Protection since 2009, sent shares tumbling. Lacher had overseen Allstate’s auto-coverage business, which has lost customers for most of the last three years. Direct-to-consumer rivals such as Progressive Corp. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Geico unit have added policies as drivers shun agents and purchase coverage over the Internet. Home Insurance Lacher also managed Allstate’s business that covers residential property. Allstate said in June that returns from the homeowners unit were “inadequate.” Allstate has received approval in 18 states to raise homeowners rates, according to today’s statement. The company competes with policyholder-owned State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest U.S. home and auto insurer. “I don’t know if you can necessarily put the blame on Joe fully for not being able to turn things around” since some of the trends predate his tenure, said Brian Meredith, an analyst at UBS AG. Lacher “was actually in the process of trying to fix it.” Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, slumped to $35.95 a share from $36.51 at the end of March. Wilson has reshaped Allstate’s investment portfolio since 2008, when writedowns contributed to an annual loss of $1.68 billion. He bought corporate bonds while cutting back on stocks, commercial mortgage-backed securities and municipal debt. Allstate posted $57 million in realized investment gains in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $451 million a year earlier, on fewer writedowns and narrower derivative losses.

{"headline": "Yuan Completes Fifth Quarterly Gain on Economic Recovery Signs", "article": "China’s yuan completed its fifth straight quarter of gains on stronger central bank fixings amid signs Asia’s largest economy is recovering from a slowdown. The People’s Bank of China raised its daily reference rate , which limits the yuan’s daily moves to 1 percent on either side, by 0.5 percent to 6.1480 this quarter. Manufacturing activity increased for q second month in September, while exports advanced for a second month in August, official data show. The yuan’s appreciation has slowed since end-June after gaining the most since 2011 in the previous three months amid a cash squeeze engineered by authorities to curb excessive lending. “The yuan was supported by improving growth momentum,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “Onshore demand for the yuan is not as strong as a quarter ago due to the liquidity crunch.” The Chinese currency gained 0.25 percent this quarter to 6.1220 per dollar in Shanghai, after strengthening 1.2 percent in the previous three months, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices showed. It slipped 0.03 percent today. The yuan has appreciated 1.8 percent this year, the only gainer among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The PBOC wants to keep the yuan “stable,” said Ji. For today, the market is watching developments in the U.S., where the House of Representatives voted 231-192 to stop many of the Affordable Care Act’s central provisions for one year, tying it to an extension of government funding through Dec. 15. Should the Senate reject the bill today, the government could be shut down from tomorrow. PMI, Economy China ’s Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 50.2 in September from 50.1 in August, data showed today. The economy probably grew 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey this month, up from an estimate of 7.5 percent in August. Growth was 7.5 percent last quarter, the second-weakest in four years. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the yuan climbed 1.4 percent this quarter to 6.2010 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts slipped 0.01 percent today and traded at a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot rate. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.31 percent this quarter to 6.1177 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It weakened 0.01 percent today. One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 58 basis points, or 0.58 percentage point, this quarter to 1.23 percent. It slipped one basis point today.

{"headline": "Michelin Tightens Cost Controls as Currency Burdens Sales", "article": "Michelin & Cie. (ML) , Europe’s largest tiremaker, said currency shifts in the U.S., Japan and South America more than offset global delivery gains causing it to review spending plans after third-quarter revenue dropped. Sales fell to 5.12 billion euros ($7.06 billion) from 5.44 billion euros a year earlier, even as delivery volumes rose 2 percent, the Clermont-Ferrand, France-based company said late yesterday in a statement. That missed the 5.33 billion-euro average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell the most in three months. The tiremaker forecast that operating profit will rise by about 150 million euros before one-time items and currency effects, which will be “more deeply negative” than anticipated at the beginning of the year. The depreciation of the dollar and yen has undone the French manufacturer’s efforts to boost volumes by growing outside Europe , where demand has been hit by recession. The company is investing in additional capacity in new markets and by selling tires for mining equipment and other large vehicles. Europe’s contraction has already prompted the tiremaker to look at ways to trim costs in the region, where about 59 percent of its 107,000 workers are employed. Shares Drop The stock fell as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest drop since July 25, and was down 3.9 percent at 76.68 euros as of 9:11 a.m. in Paris trading. The shares have gained 7 percent this year, valuing the company at 14.4 billion euros. Michelin expects foreign-exchange fluctuations to burden full-year operating profit by about 250 million euros, Chief Financial Officer Marc Henry said on a conference call. The company previously forecast a negative currency impact of as much as 150 million euros for 2013. Nine-month revenue declined 5.3 percent to 15.3 billion euros. To offset foreign-exchange headwinds, the company will further tighten control over costs. Michelin still sees global volumes steady as Europe recovers from the effects of the sovereign-debt crisis. Car, truck and specialty tires global markets all advanced over the first nine months of the year. “In light of the outlook for volume growth in the fourth quarter, Michelin confidently maintains its full-year objective of stable volumes,” the company said in the statement. Michelin laid out a strategy on Sept. 18 to deliver 1 billion euros in structural free cash flow a year by 2020, as well as at least a 15 percent return on capital employed. The company expects its expansion outside Europe to ease foreign-exchange risks over time, as costs and revenues in various currencies are more balanced. “What is clear to us is that Michelin provides a natural hedging through a balanced geographic portfolio,” said CFO Henry on the call. “The geographical portfolio and the portfolio of activities of Michelin is bringing us a natural hedge that is quite impressive.” To contact the reporter on this story: Mathieu Rosemain in Paris at  mrosemain@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미쉐린의 3분기 매출이 전년 동기 대비 감소한 주요 원인은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미쉐린이 외화 환율 변동으로 인해 예상보다 더 큰 부정적 영향을 받게 된 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "미쉐린이 유럽 외 지역으로의 확장을 통해 외화 환율 변동 위험을 완화하려는 전략은 어떻게 작동하며, 장기적으로 어떤 효과를 기대할 수 있는가?"}]}

{"headline": "Thai Baht Has Best Week in Two Months on Fund Inflows to Bonds", "article": "Thailand ’s baht had its biggest weekly gain in two months as the country’s improving economy attracts fund inflows into the bond markets from abroad. Cash is flowing into Thai assets as global investors shun Malaysia , which is close to an election, and Indonesia owing to its current-account deficit, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on March 20, adding that special measures to stem the inflows aren’t needed yet. The baht touched a 16-year high this week as options contracts betting on gains became more expensive than those used to protect against declines. “Unlike Malaysia and Indonesia in Southeast Asia, Thailand doesn’t have a big concern that shakes the country at this moment,” said Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit department in Tokyo. “With lots of liquidity supplied by central banks in developed nations, funds are coming to Southeast Asia, and Thailand stands out with its economic growth and political stability.” The baht climbed 0.8 percent this week, the most since the five-day period ended Jan. 18, to 29.30 per dollar as of 3:19 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency declined 0.3 percent today, having touched 29.08 on March 20, the strongest level since a devaluation sparked the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Global funds purchased $442 million more sovereign debt than they sold this week through yesterday, taking this month’s net purchases to $2.5 billion, Thai Bond Market Association data show. Overseas funds poured in a net $2.7 billion in February and $3.7 billion in January. International investors sold a net $220 million of local equities this week through yesterday, exchange data show. Volatility Rises One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage point, from a week ago to 5.19 percent. The rate climbed eight basis points today. Call options granting the right to buy the baht in a month’s time cost 0.14 percentage point more than put contracts, compared with a discount of 0.03 percentage point on March 15. The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 dropped seven basis points this week to 3.55 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to July 17 rose 1.2 percent, compared with a 1.8 percent increase in the 33 weeks to May 15, the Birmingham, England-based company said in a statement today. The World Cup had a “negative impact” on food sales, reducing overall like-for-like sales by about 2 percent, it said.  “If there’s a challenge it’s managing the consumer uncertainty,” Chief Executive Officer Adam Fowle told reporters on a conference call today. “The emergency budget has raised the spectre of hardship for consumers. That’s the risk. They are still massively more confident that they were in November.”  U.K. consumer confidence measures by Nationwide Building Society fell to the lowest in a year in June as the government’s planned budget cuts spooked consumers.

{"headline": "Groupon China Venture to Merge With Tencent-Backed FTuan", "article": "Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the biggest daily coupon website, is combining its Gaopeng online-commerce venture in China with FTuan, a company backed by local partner Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  Gaopeng, in which Chicago-based Groupon owns a minority stake, will continue to offer its own brand alongside FTuan after the merger, according to a statement from Groupon and Tencent yesterday. The transaction with FTuan, which provides consumers low-priced deals for dining and purchases, is part of Groupon’s strategy to “strengthen” its investment in China, Groupon said. Terms weren’t disclosed. Groupon is deepening its partnership with Tencent, China’s biggest Internet company, as they compete against hundreds of similar group buying sites offering discount deals for online shoppers. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma’s Yunfeng Capital is also among investors in Gaopeng, which had struggled to adapt to the Chinese market since starting last year, according to Alex Wang at research company iResearch. “Gaopeng was a newcomer to the Chinese market,” Wang, a Beijing-based analyst, said by phone. “Gaopeng and FTuan will benefit from savings in product sourcing and operations.” Tencent rose 3.2 percent to HK$225.60 in Hong Kong trading today, the biggest contributor by index points to the 1 percent climb in the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. (HSI) Groupon gained 3.6 percent to $10.25 in New York yesterday, the third-best performing stock in the Nasdaq Internet Index. (QNET)  FTuan Views FTuan, based in Beijing, had an average of 566,000 daily page views last month, making it the ninth most-popular group- buying site in China, according to iResearch. Gaopeng ranked 10th with 486,000 views, according to the researcher. “It takes time to cultivate the market in China,” said George Zhang, who represents Gaopeng at the Bite Communications public relations agency in Beijing. “It’s too early” to assess the performance of Gaopeng’s business, said Zhang, who couldn’t immediately provide user numbers. China’s group-buying industry is “consolidating” as the number of operators declined to fewer than 1,000, from more than 3,000 last year, iResearch’s Wang said. Meituan.com is the industry leader with almost 4 million average daily page views, Wang said. Groupon faced setbacks in China last year, when it fired workers for poor performance, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. Former and current employees of Gaopeng said the joint venture closed more than 10 offices in the country, and a lawyer representing former Gaopeng employees estimated that about 400 people were fired, according to the Wall Street Journal. Industry Sales China’s online group-buying market generated estimated revenue of 4.3 billion yuan ($676 million) last year, more than doubling from 1.5 billion yuan in 2010, according to iResearch. FTuan attracted about $30 million of investment from Tencent in March 2011. It raised a further $60 million in September 2011 from several investors including Tencent, according to FTuan. Tencent said last month it plans to invest $1 billion in e- commerce operations.

{"headline": "RealPlayer Simplifies Video Sharing: Rich Jaroslovsky", "article": "There’s no reason you need to know what a codec is. Unless you’ve tried to view or share video shot on one type of device, say an Android phone, on another, like an iPhone. Until now, that could have plunged you into a frustrating world of obscure technical jargon, not to mention running into file-size limits imposed by your e-mail system. But a new service from digital-media pioneer RealNetworks (RNWK) reduces the pain considerably. It’s called RealPlayer Cloud, and it combines online viewing, sharing and storage into a smooth, comprehensive experience. The basic problem with sharing videos is that they aren’t photos. There are only a few widely used digital-photo formats, and pretty much any device can view them, making possible sites like Yahoo (YHOO) ’s Flickr and Facebook (FB) ’s Instagram for easy personal storage and sharing. Videos, by contrast, come in a bewildering array of formats that often require tinkering to get them to play on devices other than what they were created on. That’s where RealPlayer Cloud comes in. Like Dropbox, Google Drive and Apple (AAPL) ’s iCloud, it lets you save your videos to the Internet, where they can be accessed remotely. Unlike those other services, though, it also prepares them for viewing across platforms. Free Apps You access the service via free apps available in Apple’s App Store for iPhones and iPads and the Google Play store for Android devices, as well as on Windows PCs and Roku’s set-top TV box. A version for Macs is in the works, the company says; in the meantime, Mac users can still access most of the cloud features via a web browser. Apple TV users can view clips via the AirPlay feature in iOS devices. To test the service, I used a variety of clips created on an iPhone 5 and 5s and two Android devices, Samsung (005930) ’s Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S III, plus some content I downloaded from the web. First, I tried sending a brief iPhone clip via e-mail to the Galaxy S III. It had to be brief; my e-mail choked on anything longer than about a minute. No matter. Attempting to watch it on the Galaxy yielded an error message: “No app can open this attachment for viewing.” Seamless Streaming I then uploaded the same video using the RealPlayer Cloud app on the iPhone and accessed it from the app on the Galaxy; it opened and ran seamlessly. I repeated the process with a number of clips, all of which ran well. I also watched them on a PC, uploaded and watched much longer clips than e-mail could have handled, and shared them with recipients who neither had nor needed the RealPlayer service. A lot goes on behind the scenes to make all this possible. RealPlayer employs a technology it calls SurePlay that automatically reformats a video to adjust for the type of playback device, size of the screen and available bandwidth and local storage. But all that is, mercifully, invisible to the user; the video just plays. The basic, free service comes with two gigabytes worth of free storage, which is about enough to store an hour of high-definition video, or three to four hours of standard-def. You can earn more free storage, up to 3.5 gigabytes, by adding devices to your account. More Storage You can also buy additional capacity starting at $5 a month, or $49 a year, for 25 gigabytes and ranging up to $30 a month, or $299 a year, for 300 gigabytes. Forget about using the top tier to share your collection of movies or TV shows, though. As an anti-piracy measure, videos longer than 15 minutes that are uploaded via computer can only be viewed by the account-holder, not by anyone else. (There’s no such restriction for videos shot on a mobile device.) The conversion process, though swift, isn’t instantaneous. RealNetworks says clips uploaded to the cloud should immediately begin to play on another device, but I found that, while they showed up in a moment, it sometimes took two or three minutes before they were playable. In addition, the soundtrack of a video shot on the iPhone appeared slightly out of sync a couple of times when viewed using Google (GOOG) ’s Chrome browser on a PC. (RealNetworks says it hasn’t encountered that issue before.) And a feature that was supposed to let enabled devices on the same Wi-Fi network recognize each other for easier file transfers wouldn’t work in my office, though it did at home. RealPlayer Cloud certainly isn’t the only way to view and share video across different devices. YouTube, for one, has been doing it for years, and has options allowing you to restrict who can see your content. But YouTube is more about reaching an audience. RealPlayer Cloud’s personal storage and easy sharing make for a useful combination. ( Rich Jaroslovsky is a Bloomberg News columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

{"headline": "Greece Will Default on Debt After EU Plan: S&P", "article": "Greece will partially default on its debt once European officials push through a plan that will see bondholders foot part of the bill of a second bailout agreed to last week in Brussels, Standard & Poor’s said. The rating company also cut its ranking for Greece to CC, two steps above default, from CCC, according to a statement published in London today. The outlook on the debt is negative. “The proposed restructuring of Greek government debt would amount to a selective default under our rating methodology,” S&P said. “We view the proposed restructuring as a ‘distressed exchange’ because, based on public statements by European policy makers, it is likely to result in losses for commercial creditors.” EU leaders agreed last week that bondholders will contribute 50 billion euros ($72 billion) to a new rescue package, with euro-region governments and the International Monetary Fund putting up a further 109 billion euros. The July 21 accord strengthened the region’s bailout mechanism to offer protection to other euro-region nations such as Ireland and Spain to avert contagion. “The risk of default at those levels is pretty inevitable,” said Vincent Truglia, managing director at New York-based Granite Springs Asset Management LLP and a former head of the sovereign risk unit at Moody’s Investors Service. “You’re going to get, at the minimum, a distressed exchange. Greece will become a serial defaulter because the amount of debt reduction that’s proposed is not really adequate.” Euro Falls The euro fell 1 percent to $1.4369 at 2:27 p.m. in New York , after the S&P announcement. Greece hired BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc to act as joint dealer-managers of its voluntary bond exchange and debt-buyback plan, the Athens-based Finance Ministry said in a statement today. The lenders will provide a committed financing facility to Greece, the ministry said. S&P’s move followed Moody’s Investors Service, which on July 25 cut Greece’s long-term credit rating by three steps to Ca, its second-lowest rating. Fitch Ratings cut Greece by three levels to CCC on July 13. The cost of insuring against a default by Greece was at 1,695 basis points today, implying a 76 percent chance the government will fail to pay its debts within five years. The price of the contracts soared to a record 2,568 basis points on July 18, when the probability of default approached 90 percent, according to CMA. Not a ‘Big Shock’ “There hasn’t been a big shock to the market as it’s mostly water under the bridge,” said David Keeble , head of fixed income strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in New York. “I think the market is prepared for the next step, which is selective default and which should happen in a month or so.” S&P said its recovery rating of ‘4’ for Greece remained unchanged, signaling an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent recovery of principal by bondholders, including on bonds subject to a 20 percent reduction in net present value as estimated under the Institute for International Finance’s proposal. Under the EU’s second rescue program for Greece in 15 months, banks will voluntarily write down the value of their bonds by 21 percent as part of the exchanges, the IIF, which represents banks and insurers, said July 22. The plan will lengthen the average maturity of privately held Greek debt to 11 years from six years. S&P, in a separate report, said some provisions of the EU’s rescue plan would help protect Ireland and Portugal. “We think these maturity extensions and interest-rate reductions should be beneficial for the debt sustainability of both Ireland and Portugal,” S&P said. S&P assigns a selective default when it decides a borrower has defaulted on a specific class of obligations yet will likely meet other payment obligations in a timely manner.

{"headline": "A Tea Party at Sea: The Ticker", "article": "Outside Michele Bachmann's gloomy caucus party last night at the West Des Moines Marriott, a lone sentinel dressed in Revolutionary War garb -- the Tea Party equivalent of gang tats -- stood watch over the disaster. Bachmann's campaign, which mustered only 5 percent of Iowa caucus votes, will not be crossing the Delaware anytime soon. It is currently navigating the River Styx. Texas Governor Rick Perry, another Tea Party favorite, invested heavily in Iowa and finished with a dismal 10 percent. Newt Gingrich , who channeled Tea Partyers' contempt even as he gave them whiplash on their core issues, emerged with an unlucky 13 percent. Gingrich has enough money (perhaps) and venom (surely) to cause some modest trouble for Mitt Romney, whom he called a \"liar\" the other day, but not enough to defeat him. So leaving Iowa , the front-running campaigns belong to Romney, a technocrat from Massachusetts who is viscerally distrusted by the Tea Party base; Rick Santorum, a social conservative from Pennsylvania whose soon-to-be-highlighted Congressional record from the faraway 1990s will not jibe with Tea Party dogma circa 2012; and Ron Paul, the Republican Brother From Another Planet. One of the ironies of the current Republican landscape is that the Tea Party is having a ball in Washington , D.C., where its acolytes keep House Speaker John Boehner on a short leash (attached to a spiked collar, it seems, judging from the perpetual grimace on Boehner's face). Out in the heartland, however, the sacred soil where the Real Americans of Tea Party lore hold sway, the Tea Party is getting its grandfather's clock cleaned.

{"headline": "China Money-Market Rate Falls to Three-Week Low After Reserve-Ratio Cut", "article": "China ’s money-market rate touched a three-week low on speculation the supply of cash is increasing since the reduction in banks’ reserve ratios took effect. The seven-day repurchase rate , which measures interbank funding availability, dropped for a third day after the People’s Bank of China suspended one-year bill sales for a ninth week. The central bank issued 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of 28-day repurchase contracts, according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. “Liquidity has improved a lot after the reserve-ratio cut became effective on Feb. 24,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “The central bank probably won’t resume bill sales this week because bill redemptions are too low.” The seven-day repurchase rate was steady at 3.66 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched 3.45 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 6. A total of 2 billion yuan of central bank bills and repurchase contracts will mature this week, Liu said. The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at 3.35 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the 3.44 percent government bond due June 2016 was unchanged at 3.16 percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center. -- Judy Chen.

Improving the foreign-investment climate and removing the monopoly status of state-owned companies will boost productivity and economic growth, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report today. Doing so will help China escape the stagnant growth that has befallen other rapidly industrializing countries, the group said. “Productivity in the Chinese economy must increase and improve if China is going to develop beyond middle income status,” Amcham China President Chris Murck said at a briefing. “Many multinational companies in the U.S. and Europe and Japan and other places have been focused for a long time on how to increase productivity and how to manage costs.” More foreign investment should be allowed in banking, health-care and telecommunications, according to the report. Murck said that air pollution in China is “a truly negative factor” that has led some companies to bring back hardship premiums for their expatriate staff in Beijing. In an annual survey released last month, the Chamber said U.S. companies operating in China believe rising labor costs are the biggest risk to their business in the country.

{"headline": "Colombian Yields Drop as Echeverry Predicts Narrowing Budget Gap", "article": "Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing yields down to the lowest in a month, after Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the budget deficit may narrow. The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt due in July 2024 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.04 percent, according to the central bank. That is the lowest closing yield since May 8. The price rose 0.219 centavo to 123.543 centavos per peso. The budget deficit will be 1.2 percent of gross domestic product this year and may fall below 1 percent next year, Echeverry said yesterday in Cartagena. “It takes some of the pressure off for bond offerings next year,” Pedro Ospina, a fixed-income analyst at Interbolsa SA in Bogota, said in a phone interview. “There’s optimism because of many reasons, including the sustainability of the debt, while inflation is still under control. Those fundamentals have led to a drop in yields.” The central bank cited in minutes of the May policy meeting published today cooling demand and “moderate” inflation risk in its decision to hold borrowing costs steady. Colombia ’s central bank isn’t contemplating reductions to its target lending rate even as Europe ’s debt crisis casts a “gray cloud” over the Andean economy, central bank board member Cesar Vallejo said in an interview in Cartagena yesterday. The 5.25 percent target lending rate neither cools nor stokes inflation, according to Vallejo. Vallejo’s comments are also helping drive gains in the benchmark peso bonds due in July 2024, according to Ricardo Bernal , head analyst at brokerage Serfinco SA in Bogota. “His comments are reassuring in that the central bank doesn’t see an impact on the Colombian economy so strong that there is a need to cut rates as the market has been pricing in,” Bernal said. The peso depreciated 0.4 percent to 1,776.75 per U.S. dollar today, the biggest decline among major Latin American counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.

{"headline": "Australia Cuts Iron Ore Estimate as Prices Drop on China Outlook", "article": "Australia, the world’s largest iron ore exporter, lowered its price estimates for the steelmaking raw material this year and 2014 as economic growth in China slows while supply increases. Prices will average $117 a ton in 2013, compared with $119 forecast in March, the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics said in a report. Australia may ship 571 million tons this year and 664 million tons in 2014, compared with March estimates of 554 million tons and 662 million tons, the Canberra-based bureau said. Exports totaled 494 million tons in 2012. Iron ore has tumbled 28 percent from a 16-month high in February, slipping into a bear market in May, on concern that economic growth in the biggest ore buyer is faltering. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week joined banks from Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings Plc in paring projections for China this year to 7.4 percent, below the government’s 7.5 percent goal. Prices have declined “in line with changing sentiment over China ’s economic growth and steel output,” the report said. “It is expected that the monthly rates of production will moderate as the year progresses,” it said, referring to steel. China’s steel production climbed to a record 67 million metric tons in May, according to the statistics bureau. The country will import 774 million tons of iron ore this year and 805 million tons in 2014, compared with the 773 million tons and 805 million tons estimated in March, the bureau said. Prices will average $112 a ton in 2014, compared with $114 forecast in March, the bureau said. The bureau’s price forecasts refer to ore with 62 percent iron content free-on-board Australia. The same grade delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin fell 2.2 percent to $114 a dry ton yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. Prices, which reached $158.90 on Feb. 20, have averaged $137.52 in 2013. Iron ore can be measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to 10 percent of the ore’s weight.

{"headline": "Edson Spencer, Honeywell CEO Who Gave Up IBM Fight, Dies at 85", "article": "Edson Spencer, who as head of Honeywell Inc. first battled IBM’s dominance of the computer market in the 1980s, then gave in and focused his company on automation and aerospace technology, has died. He was 85. He died on March 25 at his home in Wayzata, Minnesota, after battling progressive supranuclear palsy, a neurodegenerative brain disease, his daughter, Linda Spencer Murchison, said today in an interview. In his 34-year career at Honeywell -- known as Honeywell International Inc. (HON) since its acquisition in 1999 by AlliedSignal Inc. -- Spencer rose from an aeronautical engineer to the company’s chief executive officer from 1974 to 1987. Midway through his tenure, Honeywell’s top competitor in mainframe computers , International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , settled a long-running antitrust investigation by the U.S. Justice Department that had constrained its growth. IBM’s “power wasn’t recognizable before then,” Spencer told Computerworld magazine in 1986. With the antitrust case behind it, IBM invested in new factories and took on Japanese competitors, “and the government permitted them to go after new market share without fear of antitrust reprisal. That’s when the name of the game changed, and that’s the point at which we had to redirect our own strategies.” Honeywell, he said, had become “the freewheeling entrepreneurs who are charging off in our own direction.” ‘Outstanding Opportunity’ Within a year after that interview was published, Honeywell , then located in Minneapolis , spun off its computer unit into a venture shared with NEC Corp. of Japan and Groupe Bull SA, France ’s state-owned computer maker. As part of the restructuring, Honeywell pledged to eliminate 4,000 jobs, the Associated Press reported. It also purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group, maker of electronic gear for military and commercial aircraft, from Unisys Corp. In a statement at the time, Spencer called the purchase “an outstanding opportunity for Honeywell that positions us for the long term in a market that is expected to have significant growth for the next 10 years, commercial and military aviation.” Today, Honeywell’s aerospace unit, which makes cockpit controls and auxiliary power units, is the second-largest of the company’s four divisions, behind automation and control solutions. It had $11.5 billion of sales last year, or 31 percent of total sales of $36.5 billion for the company, now based in Morris Township, New Jersey. Railroads, Meat Packing Edson White Spencer was born on June 4, 1926, and raised in Chicago , the son of William M. Spencer, chairman of the North American Car Corp., which leased and operated railroad cars, and the former Gertrude White. His maternal grandfather, F. Edson White, worked his way up to the presidency of the Armour & Co. meat-packing business and served on the board of Chase National Bank. Spencer attended Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut , and was an usher at the 1947 wedding of his classmate and friend, William Clay Ford, grandson of the founder of Ford Motor Co., to Martha Parke Firestone, daughter of the president of the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. and granddaughter of its founder. After being discharged in 1946 as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, he graduated from Williams College and earned a master’s degree from Oxford University, which he attended for two years as a Rhodes scholar, according to his resume on the website of the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota , where he was a former chairman of the Deans Advisory Council. Climbing Honeywell’s Ladder He worked for Sears Roebuck & Co. in Sioux City, Iowa ; La Crosse, Wisconsin ; and Venezuela before settling in Minneapolis in 1954. After joining Honeywell in 1954, he worked as regional manager for Honeywell Asia based in Tokyo from 1959 to 1964, according to a death notice in the New York Times. He became an executive vice president in 1969 and was promoted to president and CEO in October 1974. After stepping down as CEO in 1987, he remained chairman for another year. U.S.-Japanese relations were among his passions, and he served on the U.S.- Japan Business Council and the Trilateral Commission, according to the notice. Spencer and his wife of 62 years, the former Harriet McClure Stuart, were founders and longtime supporters of the Yellowstone Park Foundation. In addition to Murchison they had three children: Douglas Stuart Spencer and James McClure Spencer and Edson W. Spencer Jr., founder and chairman of Affinity Capital Management in Minneapolis.

{"headline": "N. Korea Tests Don’t End ‘Provocation Pause,’ U.S. Says", "article": "North Korea’s test firings of six short-range missiles in three days may not reflect a return to a pattern of provocations by Kim Jong Un’s regime, according to the U.S. military’s top spokesman. The launches don’t in themselves end a “provocation pause” and “do not necessarily violate” North Korea’s international obligations, Pentagon spokesman George Little , told reporters yesterday in Washington. “I think we can safely say we remain in a period of tensions that are relatively small-scale by comparison” in the months after Kim’s government tested a nuclear device in February. North Korea has not fired any projectiles today as of 10:35 a.m. local time and such actions appear to have “significantly diminished,” South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said today. The regime, which fired two missiles yesterday and four over the weekend, said it is exercising its right to test-fire rockets as part of regular military drills. North Korea’s threats have moderated since annual U.S.- South Korean military exercises ended last month. Officials in Washington and Seoul have intensified diplomatic efforts to ease tensions and boost China ’s participation in global sanctions that target the North’s nuclear weapons program. “We are monitoring what is happening,” Little said. “We hope that over time the North Koreans continue to look hard at the need for peace and stability on the peninsula.” Won Rises South Korea ’s won rose 0.5 percent against the dollar after yesterday touching a four-week low, while the benchmark Kospi stock index was little changed at 1:47 p.m. in Seoul. The totalitarian state’s official Korean Central News Agency said yesterday that its missile exercises were intended to boost deterrence against rising threats from the U.S. and South Korea. Before last weekend, attention had focused on whether North Korea would conduct a test firing of its midrange Musudan rocket. With a range of 3,000 miles (4,827 kilometers) to 3,500 miles, the Musudan poses a potential threat to Guam , a U.S. territory, though not to Hawaii or the U.S. mainland, according to testimony before Congress given in April by Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of the U.S. Pacific Command. North Korea doesn’t yet have the ability to launch a nuclear-armed missile, President Barack Obama said on April 16. While South Korea sees no unusual North Korean troop movements, its military is “closely monitoring the situation” and is ready to respond to any escalation, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim said. ‘Armed Protest’ “The North is likely testing these missiles as an armed protest against the recent military drills jointly conducted by the U.S. and South Korea” in March and April, said Yang Moo Jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. After the nuclear weapon test in February, Kim’s regime threatened preemptive nuclear strikes against South Korea and the U.S. The warnings led the U.S., South Korea and Japan to boost defenses and raised concern in China, the North’s biggest ally. North Korea ’s pattern of hostile behavior seems more diverse and provocations since its long-range missile test in December “are more frequent and intense in comparison to the past,” South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung Se said today in a speech in Seoul. ‘Safeguarding Peace’ “Safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is inevitable and what everyone wants,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said yesterday. “We hope under the current circumstances all parties will do things that will ease tensions and improve relationships.” While the Obama administration has said it would seek to increase pressure on North Korea should it test a missile or nuclear device, previous UN measures have failed to deter the Kim regime. The Security Council twice this year tightened existing penalties passed in 2006 and 2009 against weapons development, financial transactions and travel. The U.S. and South Korea have repeatedly called on China, the North’s biggest trading partner, which has shielded the nation from stronger UN actions, to make greater efforts to enforce sanctions targeting the North’s nuclear weapons program. A Chinese state bank closed the account of a North Korean lender earlier this month, signaling a possible change in stance. China Evolving “There are some indications that China is slowly evolving its thoughts and stance vis-a-vis North Korea,” Yun said. North Korea’s “erratic behavior” is taking a toll on China and there is a “growing recognition” the North is becoming “a liability, instead of a strategic asset,” he added. The U.S. Air Force said yesterday that it will conduct a test of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental missile today from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The launch, originally scheduled for April 9, was postponed to avoid misinterpretation by Kim’s regime as preparation for a preemptive attack to destroy North Korea’s nuclear weapons facilities, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of access to classified intelligence.

{"headline": "Hungary’s Pledge to Work With IMF on Loan Boosts Markets After Bond Rout", "article": "Hungary ’s bonds and the forint rallied for a second day as Prime Minister Viktor Orban pledged to cooperate with central bank President Andras Simor after a dispute about the bank’s independence threatened the country’s bailout. Ten-year government bonds (GHGB10YR) in forint climbed, cutting the yield 34 basis points to 10.06 percent, according to generic prices compiled by Bloomberg. Hungary’s currency appreciated as much as 1 percent and traded 0.4 percent stronger at 317.77 per euro by 12:26 a.m. in Budapest, paring this week’s loss to 0.9 percent after reaching a record low of 324.24 yesterday. It’s in Hungary’s interest to get an International Monetary Fund agreement “as soon as possible” and there’s a “good chance” for swift talks, Orban told reporters in Budapest after meeting with Simor today. The government will hold daily consultations with the central bank and do “everything” to help the institution maintain economic stability, Orban said. “The government’s commitment to an agreement with the IMF and EU has increased,” Levente Papa, a Budapest-based strategist at OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest lender, said by e-mail today. “That’s shown by the fact that the prime minister met the central bank president despite the earlier tensions. Today’s developments certainly ease market concerns.” The cost of insuring Hungary’s debt through credit-default swaps reached an all-time high this week and the forint touched a record low against the euro after aid negotiations with the IMF and the European Union broke off because of new laws that threaten to undermine the central bank’s independence. The CDS contracts fell to 695 basis points from 735 basis points yesterday, the highest close on record, data provider CMA said. The central bank confirmed in a statement today that it will hold “regular consultations” with the government. The central bank law is “fully compatible” with EU regulations and the government will continue to respect the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s independence, Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said in a letter sent to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and published by the ministry yesterday. Orban’s comments may not have a longer-term impact on the forint as Hungary still needs to change its central bank law to get an IMF agreement, Raffaella Tenconi, a London-based economist at Bank of America Corp., said in a telephone interview today. “It will depend on how quickly and how smoothly the negotiations go,” Tenconi said. The benchmark BUX (BUX) stock index rose 0.9 percent as OTP Bank advanced 2.1 percent and Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the country’s former phone monopoly, rose 1.5 percent.

{"headline": "Farmers at Center of Mad Cow Probe Grumble Over Tainted Image", "article": "Mike Correia and four other weathered men in blue jeans and soiled work boots gathered for coffee at a gas station outside Hanford, California. The farming center is where the fourth case of mad cow disease ever found in the U.S. has surfaced. The topic was the media. “The dairy business is hurting already and we don’t need this,” said Correia, seated at a dinette table near the cash register. He grows feed for cattle nearby in the southern San Joaquin valley. “Dairy down here makes the world go.” Farmers fear a repeat of 2003, when the first confirmed U.S. case led to losses estimated as high as $4.7 billion in 2004 for the American beef industry. Within hours of the latest announcement, cattle futures plummeted to a nine-month low. Some South Korean retailers said they would suspend imports of U.S. beef. “Mad cow disease” was the most-searched term on Google for a time yesterday. Correia, 56, and the other farmers gathered around that table complained about how television news showed stock footage of sickened cows that was unrelated to the case in California. “People are going to think it’s in the food chain and the media is blowing it out of proportion,” Correia said. “They are scaring people and they have nothing to worry about.” The diseased cow arrived April 18 at a Baker Commodities Inc. facility just outside of Hanford, where so-called deadstock are held before going to a rendering plant, Dennis Luckey, executive vice president of operations at Los Angeles-based Baker, said in a telephone interview. Rendering Products Cattle and dairy farmers typically pay such rendering companies to haul away cows not intended for the dinner table. The company turns the carcasses into protein supplements for chickens and pigs, an ingredient in pet food, and other products, according to Baker’s website. A dead dairy cow at the company’s transfer station in Hanford was identified by a routine test for the brain-wasting disease, known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, agriculture officials said April 24. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sought to reassure the public, saying the infected animal didn’t enter the human food chain. “People are going to panic,” Dave Thomas, who owns a small dairy farm with 300 cows and two workers just west of town, said as he inspected his milking stalls. “There’s nothing I can do about that.” Scientists say the disease is spread through feed that contains brain or spinal cord tissue from infected animals. People can get it from eating products containing such tissues, including head cheese. Since 1997, feed made from mammals has been banned from cattle rations, and high-risk materials such as brains have been kept from the human food supply , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ‘Atypical’ Disease The California cow tested positive for so-called atypical BSE, which the Agriculture Department said isn’t generally associated with an animal consuming infected feed. Such cases can occur spontaneously in older animals, according to the department. In Hanford, a community of 55,000 about 200 miles northwest of Los Angeles , many people were taking the development in stride. The community is a trading hub for hundreds of sprawling dairy farms, orchards and crop fields in the surrounding area. The public should be reassured by the routine and random testing, said Steve Maddox, named 2011 Outstanding Dairy Producer of the Year by Western DairyBusiness magazine. “The nice thing about this situation is that the system works,” said Maddox, who milks about 3,500 cows in Hanford. “Our controls and systems that we have in place are doing what they’re supposed to do.” After the USDA announcement, Maddox said he spent 45 minutes on the telephone with his congressman, U.S. Representative Jim Costa, a Fresno Democrat. ‘Rumors Kill Us’ “He asked me what he could do to help,” Maddox said. “I told him the most important thing right now is that accurate information gets out. It’s the rumors that kill us.” Mad cow disease has been most prevalent in the U.K., which has had 184,000 cases since 1987. Last year, 29 cases were reported worldwide. Canada , the biggest U.S. agricultural trading partner, had 19 as of February 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The discovery in California spurred fresh calls for increased monitoring of the U.S. meat supply. In 2003, after the first case, dozens of countries shut their doors to U.S. shipments. Some nations, including China , have maintained part of the restrictions ever since. Sold for Slaughter “We beefed some cows just today, and I was afraid the price would drop, but we got lucky and they paid us the same price,” said Joseph Parreira, referring to the sale of some of the 5,000 dairy cows on his father’s farm. Dairy cattle that aren’t producing enough milk to be profitable are often sold for slaughter. Live-cattle futures were up 0.2 percent at $1.12525 a pound by 11:25 a.m. London time on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price lost 2.6 percent on April 24 as the U.S. Department of Agriculture disclosed the disease, before rebounding 0.6 percent yesterday. Parreira said he has no plans to eat less beef. “Your chances of dying from an infected cow aren’t high enough to even register or worry about,” he said.

{"headline": "Persimmon CEO Retires as Homebuilder Reports Revenues Growth", "article": "Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, said Chief Executive Officer Mike Farley will step down after 30 years at the company. Farley, who has been CEO for seven years, will be replaced by Jeff Fairburn, the York, England-based company said in a statement today. Revenue in 2012 rose to 1.72 billion pounds ($2.77 billion) from 1.54 billion pounds in 2011, it said. “I intend to continue with the strong discipline that we have got in place,” Fairburn, who has been with Persimmon for 23 years, said in an interview. “I will continue to see strategic land being promoted and brought through.” Margins are expanding after the housing market’s collapse in 2008 forced homebuilders to slash costs to compensate for a slump in demand. At the same time, they exploited falling prices to snap up land cheaply. U.K. home values are little changed over the past 18 months as a lack of homes for sale supports prices while restricted mortgage lending and a weak economic recovery deter buyers. Persimmon targets an underlying operating profit margin of 15 percent to 17 percent compared with a 13 percent margin in 2012. The company owned and controlled 68,000 plots of land approved for development at the end of the year compared with 63,335 a year earlier. Persimmon’s cash balance was around 200 million pounds at the end of last year, compared with 41 million pounds a year earlier, according to the statement. Cash Positive “The big win for us is the cash position,” Farley, who turns 60 in June, said in a phone interview. “We are generating as much cash as anybody in the industry.” The homebuilder expects sales to those buying their first home to increase as the U.K.’s spring selling period begins. The company said it will be allowed to use the government’s FirstBuy financial guarantee program for an additional 3,000 properties. Though U.K. mortgage approvals rose to the highest in 10 months in November, Persimmon is unlikely to increase the number of homes it builds, according to Fairburn, who will replace Farley in April. “Until such time where there is significantly better money in the system for mortgages, our volumes are going to be subdued unfortunately,” Fairburn said by telephone. “We just want to see a mortgage market that functions for the buyer.” Home completions increased 6 percent to 9,903 and average prices gained 6 percent to 173,400 pounds from a year earlier, the company said in the statement. The outlook for this year’s housing market is mixed, with Hometrack Ltd. expecting a 1 percent decline and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and Rightmove Plc (RMV) both seeing a 2 percent increase.

Intertek Group Plc, which offers product-inspection services, dropped 2.5 percent after reporting a slowdown in revenue growth. Smiths Group Plc (SMIN) , a maker of security scanners, declined 2.3 percent after it updated investors on its results. EasyJet Plc (EZJ) jumped 7.1 percent as Europe’s second-biggest discount carrier said it will pay an additional dividend after full-year profit increased 51 percent. The FTSE 100 Index (UKX) fell 25.45 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,698.01 at the close of trading in London. The benchmark gauge has climbed 14 percent this year, reaching a valuation of 13.7 times the estimated earnings of its members, near the highest since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broader FTSE All-Share Index (ASX) lost 0.4 percent today, and Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.9 percent. Stocks “are not overvalued nor incredibly attractive,” Patrick Armstrong, who helps oversee $200 million as chief investment officer at Armstrong Investment Managers in London , said by phone. “You could easily see a melt-up into year-end as exuberance kicks in and as people tend to position themselves positively. But also, there is no clear catalyst that could drive us higher from here. I don’t expect a big move.” Fed, BOE Investors tomorrow will scrutinize minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve and Bank of England meetings to assess the prospects for monetary-policy changes. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its global growth forecasts for this year and next as emerging-market economies including India and Brazil cool. The world economy will probably expand 2.7 percent in 2013 and 3.6 percent in 2014, instead of the 3.1 percent and 4 percent predicted in May, the Paris-based OECD said in a semi-annual report today. Intertek (ITRK) lost 2.5 percent to 3,102 pence. The company said revenue excluding acquisitions increased 3 percent in the July-to-October period, down from 6.3 percent in the first half. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts reduced their earnings estimates for the company following the results, saying that growth “continues to slow.” Smiths Group Smiths Group, which has climbed 20 percent this year, dropped 2.3 percent to 1,400 pence. The company said trading in the three months to Nov. 2 and its outlook for the year are in line with expectations. Smiths Group warned that foreign-exchange rates are a “headwind” that may affect earnings. Shares of Paddy Power Plc (PWL) plunged 8.1 percent to 57.44 euros in Dublin. Ireland’s biggest bookmaker fell the most in five years after saying that poor results from sports bets will reduce operating profit more than expected. EasyJet rallied 7.1 percent, the biggest gain in the FTSE 100, to 1,345 pence after proposing to pay 44.1 pence a share, in addition to a regular dividend of 33.5 pence. Pretax profit for the 12 months to Sept. 30 rose to 478 million pounds ($770 million), topping the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey and up from 317 million pounds a year earlier. Enterprise Inns Plc (ETI) jumped 12 percent to 154 pence. The second-biggest U.K. pub chain said Chief Operating Officer Simon Townsend will replace Chief Executive Officer Ted Tuppen next year. Tuppen, who was CEO for more than 20 years, will retire Feb. 6, the company said. Enterprise Inns has fallen more than 85 percent since May 2007. Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. energy explorer in Africa and Iraq , rose 8.1 percent to 161 pence after finding more oil off Nigeria than previously forecast. The company more than tripled its estimate of recoverable oil at the Ogo prospect, drilled with Optimum Petroleum Development Ltd. and Lekoil Ltd., to 774 million barrels from 202 million barrels.

{"headline": "Nicklaus Lewis Meets Namesake in 54-Year-Old Dad’s Masters Debut", "article": "Randy Lewis wasn’t the only member of his family to fulfill a lifelong quest today at the Masters Tournament. Nicklaus Lewis, the 19-year-old son of golf’s Mid-Amateur champion, tracked down his namesake, Jack Nicklaus , moments after the six-time Masters winner hit ceremonial tee shots with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player to start the year’s first major tournament. “I showed him my nametag and told him that I have the two best last names in golf, his and my dad’s,” Nicklaus Lewis said while watching his father play Augusta National Golf Club’s 11th hole. “It was brief, but it’s been something I always wanted to do. I don’t care about any of the other big names. I just care about my dad and I wanted to meet Jack, so I’m living the dream, too.” Randy Lewis, a 54-year-old financial planner for Raymond James & Associates’ DLP Financial Group in Alma, Michigan , shot a 9-over-par 81 in what is believed by the club to be the oldest rookie appearance in Masters history. He ended up in Augusta, Georgia, by winning last year’s Mid-Amateur, a championship staged by the U.S. Golf Association created in 1988 after the U.S. Amateur began to be dominated by college players. Mid-Amateur competitors must be at least 25. “We all still have a hard time imagining what Randy has truly accomplished at the age of 54 -- for that matter -- at any age,” Daniel De Jong, who works with Lewis, said in an e-mail. “This couldn’t have happened to a nicer individual.” Support Group Nicklaus Lewis, a student at Central Michigan University, walked the undulating fairways with his older brother, Christopher; their mother, Melanie; and a throng of the elder Lewis’s supporters. All wore green bracelets with the words, “We’re pulling for you Randy.” Randy Lewis had visited the club numerous times to play practice rounds since winning the Mid-Amateur in September. On April 2, he played the course with five-time British Open champion Tom Watson , at 62 one of the few players in the tournament who is older. Lewis had written Watson a letter asking if he could play with him, telling the 1977 Masters winner that his runner-up finish in the 2009 British Open had inspired him. When Watson responded to the letter, Melanie Lewis framed it next to her husband’s Masters invitation. “I kind of have a shrine for him,” she said. When he leaves the club, Lewis will also have a closet full of Masters-logoed clothes. He has spent about $800 on merchandise and said he plans to wear a hat or shirt from the tournament as often as he can. “I’m going to be one of those guys always wearing something from here,” he said in an interview. Weekend Unlikely Lewis is unlikely to become the first Mid-Amateur champion to make the 36-hole cut for weekend play. Still, he plans to stick around as a spectator through the finish of the tournament on April 8. “They’re probably going to have to get security to escort me out of here,” he said. “I wish things would slow down, this is going way, way too fast. It’s just a place that you, gosh, just want to be here as much as you possibly can.” His son’s name can always serve as a reminder of the tournament. “We kind of subjected him to a life of having a misspelled first name,” the father said of the son. “Jack was always my hero, so it’s pretty cool.” To contact the reporter on this story: Mike Buteau in Augusta, Georgia at  mbuteau@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at  msillup@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "골프의 Mid-Amateur 챔피언십은 어떤 목적으로 만들어졌나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "Randy Lewis가 Masters Tournament에 참가하기 위해 어떤 경로를 거쳤나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "Randy Lewis가 Masters Tournament에서 경험한 일들이 그의 금융 플래너로서의 경력에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "EU Offers $6.7 Billion Bonds for Portugal, Ireland Bailouts", "article": "The European Union is selling 4.75 billion euros ($6.7 billion) of 10-year bonds to help fund the bailouts of Ireland and Portugal. The EU is offering the bonds through its European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, or EFSM, according to three people with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be identified before it’s completed. The deal is the third from the fund and follows Portugal’s request for rescue loans on April 7. “The sale should be very well-supported given it’s a triple A rated asset,” said David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. The EU is preparing to sell the top-rated bonds after saying last week it plans to raise a total of 15.3 billion euros for the two nations by July 15, through the EFSM and another fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility. Global markets have been roiled by concern some euro region countries won’t be able to repay their debt. Amadeu Altafaj, economic policy spokesman at the Brussels- based European Commission, which runs the EFSM, didn’t reply to an e-mailed request for comment. The bonds may be priced to yield about 16 basis points more than the mid-swap rate and the sale’s due to be completed tomorrow, said the people. The deal is being managed by BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse Group AG, DZ Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co, the people said. Five-Year Sale The EFSM will subsequently issue five-year notes in a deal to be arranged by Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Societe Generale SA and UBS AG, another banker said. The price of the EFSM’s 4.6 billion of existing 2018 securities sold in March climbed to 100.60 from 99.53 when it started trading, while its 5 billion euros of bonds due December 2015 fell to 99.39 from 100.34 on Jan. 10, according to Bloomberg composite prices. The EFSF -- which is overseen by euro-area governments -- made its debut bond sale in January. The EU rescue funds will sell four benchmark bonds in the second quarter valued at 3 billion euros to 5 billion euros each, and a further six deals in the second half, the commission said in a May 19 statement. The two funds are each providing 26 billion euros for Portugal, which is also getting an equivalent amount from the International Monetary Fund. For Ireland, the EFSF is providing 17.7 billion euros and the EFSM 22.5 billion euros.

{"headline": "Oaktree Reports Fourth-Quarter Profit on Gains From Investments", "article": "Oaktree Capital Group LLC , the world’s largest distressed-debt investor, reported a fourth- quarter profit after a loss a year earlier as it realized more gains on investments. Net income was $39.3 million, or $1.30 a share, compared with a loss of $28.9 million, or $1.28 a share, a year ago, Los Angeles-based Oaktree said in a statement today. Assets under management declined to $77.1 billion from $81 billion at the end of the third quarter as the firm distributed capital to investors. Oaktree, which went public last year, has told clients it’s targeting the lowest returns it has sought as it aims for gross returns of 15 percent in its distressed strategies, Chairman Howard Marks said in December. The firm is hunting for returns in the emerging markets, starting its first fund to buy dislocated debt in those countries, according to an investor letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The firm also plans to raise $3 billion for its latest distressed-debt fund that seeks to take control of companies, according to people familiar with the matter. “Asset values are fairly reasonable,” Marks said yesterday at Credit Suisse Group AG’s financial services conference in Miami. “Equity price-to-earnings ratios are below average, high-yield bond spreads are generous and real estate prices are down. So that’s not a scary outlook.” Oaktree reported results before U.S. markets opened for trading. The shares have advanced 16 percent to $49.90 since the firm’s April 11 initial public offering. Oaktree raised $380 million in the IPO, selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each, the bottom of the proposed range. Adjusted net income, a measure of profit excluding some costs, rose to $220.4 million, or $1.36 a share, from $76.7 million, or 33 cents, a year ago, Oaktree said. Adjusted net income excludes some expenses, including noncash equity compensation and income taxes.

Along with military and police officers, judges, cabinet ministers from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union- Patriotic Front party and senior civil servants, Mugabe’s closest allies own almost 5 million hectares (12,355,269 acres) of farmland, the news agency said.

{"headline": "Indiana Board to Consider Tea Party Questions on Lugar Residency", "article": "The Indiana Election Commission is being asked to determine whether U.S. Senator Richard Lugar is a resident of the state and deserving of a place on this year’s ballot. The Tea Party-backed challenge gives Democrats a new avenue of attack in a race in which their candidate starts out with a financial disadvantage against the six-term Republican. “Whether or not it’s legal, it’s not right,” Ben Ray, a spokesman for the Indiana Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview, referring to Lugar’s residency status. If Lugar survives the primary, he would face Democratic U.S. Representative Joe Donnelly, who has been making a point on his campaign kickoff tour of telling voters that he works in Washington , then spends most weekends in Indiana. Backers of Lugar’s challenger in the May 8 Republican primary, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, asked for the ruling on the legality of Lugar’s candidacy, given that Lugar sold his home in Indiana in 1977 after he was first elected to the Senate and moved his family to McLean, Virginia. The complaint is on the agenda of the Feb. 24 meeting of the four-member Election Commission. Lugar’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment today. The senator told RTV 6, an Indianapolis television station, he had received assurances from two state attorneys general that his “residency situation” was “proper and correct.” The station also reported that Lugar said he wasn’t sure of the address on his driver’s license, and presumed it listed the house he sold in 1977. Lugar’s Advantage As 2012 began, Lugar had a 4-to-1 cash advantage over both Donnelly and Mourdock. Lugar’s campaign reported $4.04 million on hand, compared with $847,000 for the Donnelly campaign and $363,000 reported by the Mourdock campaign. On Feb. 14, the anti-tax group Club for Growth endorsed Mourdock. Lugar subsequently started running a television ad labeling Mourdock a “mudslinger,” according to a report in the Evansville Courier and Press. In an e-mailed statement, Mourdock spokesman Chris Conner said the campaign was making the argument that Lugar is out of touch. “He has actively chosen not to live in our state since 1977 so he doesn’t hear the concerns of the people of our state,” the spokesman said.

{"headline": "Big Companies ‘A Bit Wary’ on Technology Spending, HP Chief Says", "article": "Large corporations are exercising caution about large-scale information technology spending amid concerns about global economic growth and fiscal uncertainty, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker said. While technology upgrades are under way at many companies, “everybody’s a bit cautious in an environment like this,” Apotheker said today on the sidelines of the Rencontres Economiques conference in Aix-en-Provence, France. “People are still a bit wary.” Providers of computer hardware and services are benefiting unevenly from a rebound in technology spending. HP’s rival Oracle Corp. (ORCL) reported a surprise decline in hardware sales last month. Still, IT spending by companies and governments in the U.S. is expected to grow 5.6 percent this year, about double the estimated rate of growth in gross domestic product, according to market researcher IDC. Apotheker, who took over HP last November after leaving SAP AG, is looking to slice costs and spur sales after cutting $1 billion from the company’s annual revenue projection in May. Under its new CEO, HP is shifting toward cloud-based services and new devices like tablet computers to reduce reliance on traditional personal computers. In May, he warned employees to expect “another tough quarter” in the July period and urged managers to cut expenses. HP is continuing discussions with other hardware manufacturers on licensing its WebOS mobile operating system for their devices, Apotheker said today, and isn’t concerned such agreements could cannibalize sales of its own TouchPad tablet. That device went on sale July 1. Samsung Electronics Co., the maker of devices based on Google Inc.’s Android software including the Galaxy Tab and Nexus smartphone, is in talks to use WebOS in future devices, three people with knowledge of the discussions said earlier this year. Apotheker declined to identify the company’s potential partners in licensing the software.

{"headline": "Wheat Gains as Worsening U.S. Winter-Crop Condition Dims Outlook", "article": "Wheat climbed for the first time in three days after the government said winter-crop conditions worsened in the U.S., the largest shipper, reigniting concern that production will suffer. Corn and soybeans advanced. Wheat for delivery in July rose as much as 0.8 percent to $7.085 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after losing 3.5 percent in the past two days. Futures were at $7.06, up 0.5 percent, by 9:42 a.m. in Singapore on volume that was 48 percent below the 100-day average for that time of day. About 32 percent of the winter-wheat crop was rated good- to-excellent as of May 5, down from 33 percent a week earlier and 63 percent a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some 23 percent of the spring-variety was planted, behind last year’s 82 percent and an average of 50 percent in the previous five years, the USDA said yesterday. “The USDA’s weekly crop progress report showed a further deterioration in the U.S. winter-wheat crop conditions and underlined the slow pace of spring wheat seeding,” Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a report e-mailed today. Corn for July delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to $6.405 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $6.3775. Planting of corn in the U.S., the largest grower, was 12 percent complete in the week ended May 5, the slowest pace for that week since 1984, according to the USDA. The slow pace of planting “should ensure production concerns remain a feature of the corn market over the next week or so,” Mathews said. Soybeans for July delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $13.7375 a bushel. About 2 percent of the soybean crop was seeded, trailing the average of 12 percent for that week in the previous five years, a USDA report showed.

{"headline": "U.S. Stock Futures Rise as French Borrowing Costs Decline After Auction", "article": "U.S. stock-index futures rose as French borrowing costs fell in the first sale of bills since Standard & Poor’s downgraded the country. Carnival Corp. (CCL) tumbled 14 percent in German trading after its Costa Concordia cruise liner ran aground off Italy’s Tuscan coast, killing at least six people and injuring 60. S&P 500 Index (SPX)  futures expiring in March rose 0.2 percent to 1,291.4 at 11:30 a.m. in New York, paring an earlier drop of 0.6 percent. The equity gauge climbed 0.9 percent last week and reached a five-month high on Jan. 12. U.S. markets are closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday today. “The bill auctions have been carried out without a problem, which is helpful for market sentiment toward the euro area,” said Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The reaction to the S&P downgrade has been somewhat muted. The move wasn’t a surprise and was well-flagged for a number of the issuers.” France sold 1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of one-year notes today at a yield of 0.406 percent, down from 0.454 percent on Jan. 9. as investors shrugged off S&P’s downgrade. The agency warned on Jan. 13 that the euro area’s efforts to fight its sovereign-debt crisis have fallen short as it lowered the top ratings of France and Austria by one level to AA+. It downgraded Italy, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus by two steps and cut Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia by one level. It affirmed the grades of countries including Germany, Belgium and Ireland. Quarterly Results Investors will be watching fourth-quarter earnings. Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Microsoft Corp. are among the U.S. companies due to report this week. S&P 500 companies, which beat estimates in the previous 11 quarters, are forecast to report a 4.6 percent increase in per-share profit during the September-December period, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg. Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise operator, slumped 14 percent to $29.64 in German trading today after a cruise ship belonging to its Costa Crociere unit capsized off Italy’s Tuscan coast. The incident will cost the company $95 million this fiscal year, and Carnival said it anticipates additional expenses that are impossible to determine at this time. The London-listed shares tumbled 16 percent to 1,878 pence, the biggest drop since October 2000. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the world’s second-largest cruise operator, fell 7.1 percent to $26.72 in German trading.

{"headline": "Daimler Extends Zetsche as CEO as Bernhard to Run Trucks", "article": "Daimler AG (DAI) extended Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche ’s term and named manufacturing manager Wolfgang Bernhard to run the truck unit in a possible step to the top job at the world’s third-biggest luxury-car maker. Zetsche’s contract as CEO will be prolonged until the end of 2016, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said today in a statement. Bernhard will become head of the Daimler Trucks division, the world’s largest maker of heavy vehicles, switching roles with Andreas Renschler , who will oversee production and purchasing at Mercedes-Benz cars and vans. “The chances that Bernhard could succeed Zetsche as CEO have increased further with today’s announcement,” Roman Mathyssek, a Frankfurt-based analyst at IHS Global Insight, said by phone. “There’s an unwritten law at Daimler that the CEO has to prove himself at the truck division.” Zetsche vowed 1 1/2 years ago to return the Mercedes brand to its No. 1 rank among luxury carmakers. Since then, the division has fallen further behind Munich-based Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi unit in global sales. BMW overtook Mercedes as the world’s biggest luxury-car brand in 2005. Audi, building on a presence in China , has been in second place since 2011. Shorter Contract Zetsche’s three-year contract extension is shorter than the five-year renewals common in German industry. Volkswagen prolonged CEO Martin Winterkorn ’s term by five years in 2011 and BMW approved a similar extension for CEO Norbert Reithofer in September 2010. “The supervisory board is acting in accordance with good corporate governance rules, which imply that board members who are 60 years old or turn 60 during their tenure get a contract extension of three years instead of five,” Joerg Howe, a Daimler spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Zetsche turns 60 in May. The shares dropped 1.04 euros, or 2.3 percent, to 44.09 euros at the close of trading in Frankfurt today. The stock has gained 6.7 percent this year, valuing the German company at 47.1 billion euros ($62.2 billion). Bernhard, 52, will be taking charge of the Daimler division that includes the Freightliner commercial-vehicle brand in the U.S. and Fuso in the Japan , in addition to Mercedes-Benz heavy vehicles built in Europe and Brazil. He returned to Daimler in 2009 after a five-year absence that included a stint at VW, and took the Mercedes car division’s production post in 2010. Zetsche and his predecessor Juergen Schrempp both worked in the commercial-vehicles division before becoming CEO. Swapping Jobs Renschler, 54, has overseen the truck business since October 2004, managing the division’s investments in emerging markets such as Russia and India. His work at the Mercedes car unit, which Zetsche leads, will involve implementing efficiency measures at a division that has a goal of cutting 2 billion euros in spending by 2014. As the European car market heads into a sixth consecutive annual decline, Daimler is forecasting that earnings before interest and taxes from ongoing business in 2013 will remain unchanged from last year, when operating profit dropped 10 percent to 8.1 billion euros. “A three-year contract makes sense,” said Daniel Schwarz , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “If Mercedes is going to close the gap to BMW and Audi, then results of Zetsche’s efforts should be evident by then. A five-year contract could have been seen critically by some investors.” New Models Zetsche’s strategy at Mercedes includes rolling out 13 new vehicles without predecessor models over the next eight years and fixing a disjointed sales strategy in China. He’s targeting an increase in profit starting next year, while balancing the costs of adding models, such as the CLA coupe and a compact sport-utility vehicle, with the spending-reduction targets. The CEO joined Daimler in 1976 and has since held various positions at the manufacturer’s car and commercial-vehicle divisions, including a period running the truck business. His total compensation for 2011, including fixed salary, bonuses and long-term stock options , was calculated at about 8.65 million euros, with a possible increase if Daimler beats performance targets in coming years. A member of Daimler’s management board since 1998, Zetsche was also CEO of U.S. carmaker Chrysler, a Daimler unit at the time, from 2000 to 2005. Zetsche became head of the Mercedes- Benz car division in September 2005 and succeeded Schrempp as Daimler CEO three months later. Remaking Daimler Zetsche has largely stripped the company of Schrempp’s legacy, imitating Chrysler’s separation in 2007, deciding in 2011 to discontinue the ultra-luxury Maybach brand and proceeding with an exit from European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , the parent of planemaker Airbus that Daimler helped found, with the sale of a 7.5 percent stake in December. Daimler also extended Thomas Weber ’s contract as development chief through 2016. The engineer, 58, was promoted to Daimler’s management board in 2003 and has been responsible for research and development since May 2004, overseeing the introduction of the four-door CLS coupe. Weber, who joined the then Daimler-Benz AG in 1987, has a PhD and was awarded an honorary professor title from the university of Stuttgart in 2010.

{"headline": "Tourre Juror Says Panel Found Goldman Banker ‘Shady’", "article": "Fabrice Tourre was seen as likable, unbelievable and “a bit shady,” said one of the jurors who found the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president liable for fraud in a failed $1 billion investment. Beverly Rhett, a retired special-education teacher who lives in the Bronx, New York, said the panel agreed with the government that he should have disclosed the fact that Paulson & Co., the hedge fund owned by billionaire John Paulson , helped structure the “Abacus” deal intending for the assets behind it to fail. Rhett originally spoke on condition of anonymity. She agreed yesterday to be identified by name. Tourre, 34, was found liable on Aug. 1 in Manhattan federal court on six of seven claims filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He faces penalties that U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest said will be determined later, with filings due in court later this month, and may be barred from the securities industry. The key to the verdict, Rhett said, was the government’s evidence, including documents and e-mails, that showed Tourre’s alleged duplicity. The nine jurors delivered their verdict on the second day of deliberations, giving a victory to the SEC in one of the most prominent trials to grow out of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Specialized Language Rhett said she and the others had a hard time at first following specialized Wall Street language that the lawyers and witnesses were using. At times, some of the jurors looked bored, distracted and drowsy. “I think it was too much information -- information overload for someone that’s not in that field,” she said. That changed over the course of the two-week trial. “By the end, we had people who sounded like experts” on the transaction, she said of her fellow jurors. While the jurors liked Tourre, Rhett said, she didn’t believe his story. In particular, she said she thought he misled Laura Schwartz, an executive with ACA Management LLC, a key SEC witness, about the Abacus deal. “Someone in his post should have known” that Schwartz wasn’t told about the true purpose of the deal, she said. The SEC claimed Tourre tricked ACA into serving as a third-party agent to select the assets behind the transaction by leading her to believe Paulson wanted it to succeed, rather than shorting it. ‘Critical’ Belief ACA’s former chief executive, Alan Roseman, testified that his belief that Paulson was taking a long position in Abacus was “critical” to his company’s participation. Rhett said Paolo Pellegrini , a former top Paulson executive, came across to jurors as “defensive, somewhat arrogant.” Pellegrini spent much of his time on the stand sparring with the SEC’s lead lawyer, Matthew Martens, at one point accusing the agency of tricking and intimidating him in its investigation into the Abacus deal. “That’s kind of unanimous, that he was a character,” she said of the jurors’ view of Pellegrini. Jurors based much of their decision-making on documents and e-mails the SEC argued were evidence of Tourre’s scheme. Rhett said the panel focused on Tourre’s responsibility but she believes that others at New York-based Goldman Sachs were involved in wrongdoing in the Abacus deal. ‘An Incentive’ “Twenty million dollars is certainly an incentive to scheme,” Rhett said, referring to Goldman Sachs’s anticipated fee from Abacus. “It seemed like it would have had to involve more people than him.” The firm settled SEC allegations for $550 million in July 2010, a record at the time. In the settlement, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that marketing materials for Abacus contained “incomplete information.” There was little tension among jurors, Rhett said. An early vote on one count was unanimous. They mostly spent the deliberations struggling to work through the evidence and jury instructions, she said. “We agonized and we really delved into the language as best we could,” she said. The process was about “needing to think things through” rather than getting dissenters to agree with the majority. The jurors completed their verdict around a table covered with papers, soda and water bottles and cups of coffee. In the back of the room, to the side of a plate of pastries, they drew diagrams in colored markers on a white board mounted on the wall. Tiring Work Several jurors declined to be interviewed the day of the verdict, saying they were tired from their work. As she left court, juror Beth Glover, 47, an Episcopal priest from the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said, “It was a long, slow process.” Another juror, Reece Pate, 37, a graphic designer from Rockland County, New York , said only, “It’s been a long day.” Rhett declined to disclose her age. “I have had my AARP card for a few years, now,” she told the judge during jury selection. She plans to take a cruise starting Aug. 5. “We didn’t talk a lot about the personal e-mails,” Rhett said, referring to Tourre’s notes to his then-girlfriend, in which he alternated musings about his work creating complex investments with pillow talk. In one e-mail, Tourre wrote about the “monstruousities” he was creating and quoted a friend’s nickname for him, which would later become indelible: Fabulous Fab. While jurors thought the e-mails were “somewhat invasive,” they also showed he was “a bit shady,” Rhett said. Assessing Lawyers The jury’s impressions of the lawyers in the case varied, with John “Sean” Coffey, one of Tourre’s attorneys, viewed as animated and humorous. Tourre’s lawyer Pamela Chepiga was “more deliberate, no humor, grim.” And the SEC’s Martens, who won the case, was seen as “serious, steadfast, no nonsense.” Rhett said she and the other jurors got along well. They exchanged e-mail addresses and plan a post-trial get-together. “I’m glad I served,” she said. “It was arduous. But I’m glad I was a part of it.” The juror had some advice for Wall Street, urging bankers to be “honest in your dealings.” “Explain everything,” she said. “Do not omit anything that’s pertinent to the decision-making.” The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ). To contact the reporter on this story: Bob Van Voris in federal court in Manhattan at rvanvoris@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Obama Budget Cuts Set to Squeeze Infosys’ Sales: Corporate India", "article": "Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the Indian software developer which plunged last week after forecasting sales that lagged estimates, may struggle to win clients as U.S. President Barack Obama ’s $85 billion in spending cuts prompts companies to rein in spending. Fifteen percent of prospective contracts for Infosys were canceled in the year ended March 31 as customers reduced discretionary spending for “rainy day regulations,” said Ashok Vemuri, head of Americas at the Bangalore-based company. U.S. budget cuts in manufacturing and financial services may prompt companies in those industries to reduce investment in information technology products, he said. Infosys, India ’s second-largest provider of IT services, made 62 percent of its revenue in North America last fiscal year. The reductions in Obama’s budget, which undercut his push to increase funding for research, education and infrastructure, may mean Infosys’ sales will lag behind their estimate, according to Harit Shah, an analyst with Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai. “We will start to see these cuts in bits and pieces over the next couple of quarters as they trickle down to industry,” Vemuri said in a phone interview from Bangalore. “The symptom of that is the number of deals that die before they come to the table has gone up because companies are saving cash piles to cover new regulation.” Sales Forecast Infosys’ shares fell 21 percent, the biggest slump in a decade, on April 12 after saying revenue in the year that started April 1 will grow 6 percent to 10 percent. The drop made Infosys the worst-performing stock in the 1000-company MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP) The company’s American depositary receipts lost 21 percent in New York. The company’s stock gained 1.9 percent to 2,339.05 rupees in Mumbai after dropping as much as 4 percent. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.6 percent. The company forecast for sales growth was less than the median 13 percent estimated by 66 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Indian information technology industry body Nasscom said sector sales may rise 12 percent to 14 percent in the year to March 31. The company’s earnings margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the three months ended March 31 narrowed to 26.5 percent, according to Batlivala & Karani Securities Pvt. That’s the lowest since at least 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Infosys is “a good company but unfortunately demand for its services isn’t just picking up,” Gary Greenberg, a fund manager at Hermes Fund Managers Ltd., said in an interview to Bloomberg TV. “Infosys is trying to make a transition to becoming a consultancy company but that’s harder than it looks. We happily don’t own Infosys.” Option Contracts Volumes in Infosys’ put options in India jumped to 313,902 contracts on April 12 from 125,421 a day earlier. They fell to 124,711 contracts today. Puts give the right to sell a security for a certain amount, called the strike price, by a given date. Volume of calls, which convey the right to buy, were at 161,752. Chief Executive Officer S.D. Shibulal didn’t provide an earnings-per0-share forecast, saying the “unknowns are substantial.” Shibulal and six colleagues started the company after borrowing $250 from their wives in 1981. “There’s a chance that they could miss their next guidance, but as the CEO said, there are too many variables that remain unclear to really predict what’s going to happen,” said Nirmal Bang’s Shah. “The confidence in this company has clearly gone for a toss.” Defense Contractors President Obama signed the $984 billion government funding bill into law on March 27, locking in spending cuts for research, education and infrastructure. Obama unveiled a $3.78 trillion fiscal year 2014 budget on April 10 that would end the sequester cuts. That may not reduce the “detrimental impact on spending,” Infosys’ Vemuri said. “Sequestration has already had an impact on IT services here in the U.S.,” said Washington D.C.-based Bloomberg Government analyst Afzal Bari. “The federal government gives a lot of money to states for Medicaid systems and that money is subject to cuts. States often hire Indian outsourcing companies for those projects.” Obama’s budget may reduce spending on information technology by $2.5 billion by 2015, according to Bloomberg Industries’ Anurag Rana. Companies including Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s largest defense contractor, and SAIC Inc. (SAI) may be affected, Rana said. Manufacturing companies including defense contractors and aircraft makers accounted for 22 percent of Infosys’ revenue in the three months ended March 31, while banking, financial services and insurance contributed 34 percent. Tata Consultancy Sequestration may also hurt Infosys’ rivals including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , Asia ’s biggest software developer by market value, and HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT) , Nirmal Bang’s Shah said. Tata Consultancy Chief Executive Officer Natarajan Chandrasekaran and HCL Technologies Chief Financial Officer Sandeep Kanwar said their companies haven’t been affected by the U.S. budget cuts. Tata Consultancy on April 17 may say profit increased 10 percent to 36.1 billion rupees from 29.3 billion in the quarter ended March 2012, according to Bloomberg’s survey of 38 analysts. Net income rose 23 percent in the preceding three months, while Infosys reported a 0.1 percent drop. Spending on information technology services worldwide is estimated to climb 4.5 percent this year, faster than in 2012, Gartner Inc. said on March 28. An economic revival in North America may help boost sales at software developers. U.S. Economy Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. economist Vincent Reinhart sees a 3 percent pace of growth for the world’s biggest economy in the quarter ending in June, up from 0.08 percent in December. Top information technology service providers are predicted to post “double-digit” growth as a recovery in the U.S. and in financial services stokes demand, according to Rana. Infosys, “as indicated by a dismal topline growth guidance, continues to struggle competitively, including win rates and project ramp-ups,” Moshe Katri and Avishai Kantor, analysts at New York-based Cowen & Co. said in a note to clients on April 12. “We believe Infosys’ issues continue to be company-specific rather than industry-specific.” To contact the reporter on this story: Kartikay Mehrotra in New Delhi at  kmehrotra2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "인포시스의 매출 성장률 전망치가 시장 예상치를 하회한 주요 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미국 정부의 예산 삭감이 인포시스의 사업 영역 중 특히 어떤 산업에 더 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "인포시스의 경쟁사인 타타 컨설턴시 서비스와 HCL 테크놀로지스는 미국 예산 삭감의 영향을 받지 않는다고 밝혔는데, 이 회사들이 인포시스와 비교하여 어떤 경쟁 우위를 가지고 있다고 볼 수 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "NML Urges Court Not to Delay Argentine Bond Payments", "article": "Elliott Management Corp.’s NML Capital Fund and other holders of defaulted Argentine bonds urged a court not to allow the country to go forward with $3 billion in scheduled payments on restructured debt next month without paying them as well. Lawyers for the bondholders yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan to enforce rulings he made and delayed that would require Argentina to pay on its defaulted debt whenever it makes payments on the restructured debt. In a Nov. 9 conference, Griesa said he will keep the orders on hold until he rules on two remaining issues in the case, which he said he will do by Dec. 1. Argentina is seeking a longer stay so it can go forward with the December payments while it tries to appeal. A federal appeals court in New York ruled Oct. 26 that Argentina can’t favor the restructured bondholders over holders of defaulted notes. The nation yesterday asked for a rehearing, either before the three-judge panel that ruled against it or before the entire U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. The case is NML Capital Ltd. v.

{"headline": "Popular CEO Says He Was ‘Not Involved’ in Loans to Board Members", "article": "Popular Inc. (BPOP) Chief Executive Officer Richard Carrion said today he was “not involved” in approving delinquent or troubled loans made to some board directors. “They were made with the approval of the board of directors. I was certainly not involved in that approval,” Carrion, who’s also the bank’s chairman, said today on a conference call following the San Juan-based lender’s first- quarter results. Carrion, 59, who’s been Popular’s CEO for almost two decades and sits on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , is seeking to help the bank recover from losses on soured home loans and repay $935 million to the U.S. government after a 2008 bailout. His sister and two of his nephews, one of whom is also a Popular director, have delinquent property loans to the lender, according to a regulatory filing. The bank has also restructured the loans of another director, the board’s head of corporate governance, and classifies his debts as “troubled,” the filing shows. “In the past few years, things have not worked out exactly as we expected in Puerto Rico ,” Carrion said in response to an analyst’s question. “We expect that these loans at this current level will get paid.” Popular reported first-quarter net income that more than quadrupled to $48.4 million, or 5 cents a share, from last year. It rose 3.9 percent to $1.89 at 4:30 p.m. in New York trading. The shares gained 36 percent this year. ‘Internal Procedures’ “All related party transactions are subject to internal procedures and banking laws and regulations that require they be made on market terms and conditions,” said Teruca Rullan, a spokeswoman for Popular, in a statement e-mailed earlier this week. Any transaction involving directors and their “related business interests must be approved in advance by the board of directors, which is overwhelmingly comprised of independent directors,” she said, declining to comment further on behalf of Carrion’s family members and the directors.

{"headline": "New Zealand Dollar Touches Two-Month High on Bets China Will Ease Policy", "article": "New Zealand ’s dollar touched a two- month high as a report showed China’s inflation cooled for the fifth straight month in December, increasing speculation the Asian nation will provide more monetary stimulus. The so-called kiwi held a three-day gain versus the greenback and the yen before data that may show U.S. retail sales grew, supporting demand for riskier assets. The Australian dollar was little changed as Spain and Italy prepared to auction debt this week amid concern Europe ’s fiscal crisis is worsening. “I think inflation is still cooling and that’s going to provide scope for Chinese authorities to support markets and the economies more,” said Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Both the Aussie and kiwi still continue to do quite well against the U.S. dollar .” New Zealand’s currency gained to 79.81 U.S. cents, the highest since Nov. 9, before trading at 79.65 at 1:42 p.m. in Sydney, little changed from yesterday’s close in New York. It earlier rose to 61.35 yen, also the most since Nov. 9, before changing hands at 61.243 yen from 61.25. Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0304 from $1.0310 yesterday and fetched 79.21 yen from 79.24. It was at 80.98 euro cents from 81.14 yesterday, when it reached a record high of 81.20. China’s consumer prices rose 4.1 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today.

{"headline": "OECD’s Gurria Says Food Production Needs ‘Big’ Investment Boost", "article": "OECD Secretary General Jose Angel Gurria said boosting food stockpiles in emerging and developing nations will require increased government and private spending. “Most of the potential to increase production is outside the OECD countries,” Gurria, head of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said today at a conference in Montreal. “That is where there is land available and where the gap between the current and the potential yields is enormous. But a big increase in investment is needed there.” The cost of food is projected to remain elevated into 2012. Global wheat production will lag behind demand, helping to keep food prices high and volatile at least through next year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said today on its website. Gurria offered two possible solutions to prevent future surges in food costs. “Governments could roll back the measures which mandate and subsidize biofuel consumption and production, which have created conflicts between fuel and food,” he said. “Governments could also refrain from beggar-thy-neighbor policies such as import and export restrictions.” Prices for staple foods including corn will more than double in two decades unless action is taken, Oxfam International said last week. World grain stocks will fall for a second year by the end of June 2012, the International Grains Council said May 26. The increase in food prices is “not exclusively an agricultural issue,” Gurria said. “Macroeconomic factors, energy policy , the financial and economic crises, the weather, they have all contributed.” When asked at a news conference today if the U.S. Federal Reserve’s $600 billion Treasury-purchase program, scheduled to expire at the end of the month, contributed to the recent rise in commodity prices, Gurria said, “Frankly, I don’t see a very direct link.” The OECD, comprised mostly of developed nations in Europe and North America , has 34 member states.

{"headline": "Dell, HP Earnings Expected to Herald the End of PC Era", "article": "(Corrects story that ran Nov. 15 to show Wasatch no longer holds Hewlett-Packard shares.) The PC era is ending. More evidence of the monumental shift away from personal computers will come when Dell Inc. (DELL) reports results later today, and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) announces its earnings next week. As more consumers and businesses flock to smartphones and tablets, companies led by Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) that long benefited from demand for PCs are feeling the pain. Dell will report a 10 percent drop in sales, while Hewlett-Packard’s revenue fell 6 percent in the most recent quarter, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines mark a reversal from the 1980s, when Microsoft co-Founder Bill Gates and Dell Founder Michael Dell helped usher in the PC age with low-cost machines that transformed how companies work and made it easy for consumers to use computers. The PC shunted aside bigger, pricier, more complex minicomputers and mainframes that once dominated the industry. “PC makers are succumbing to the fate of those who don’t learn from history, not even their own,” said Erik Gordon , a professor at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. The industry’s reaction has been “like responding to the early auto industry by trying to attach wheels to the hooves of horses.” Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are introducing their own tablet computers, and Microsoft has revamped its mobile- phone software in time for the year-end shopping season. Yet all three lag behind Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in tablets, and Microsoft’s share of smartphones is a fraction of the slice commanded by Apple and Google. PC Woe PC shipments tumbled 8.3 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to market researcher Gartner Inc., and are forecast to fall this year for the first annual decline since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. Windows sales fell 33 percent in Microsoft’s most recent quarter, and revenue in Intel Corp.’s key third quarter -- when PC makers typically stock up on chips for the holiday season -- declined sequentially for the first time in more than 20 years. The news probably won’t get better soon. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell may report third-quarter sales fell to $13.9 billion and earnings excluding some items tumbled 27 percent to 40 cents a share, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Growth at the computer maker has stagnated, even after an acquisition spree since 2009 to diversify into storage, information-technology services and networking gear for corporate data centers. ‘Lackluster Innovation’ “They are de-emphasizing the PC business,” said Abhey Lamba , an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. “There will be revenue headwinds from that, and their other businesses need investment.” Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California , may be in even worse shape. Fourth-quarter sales may drop to $30.5 billion and earnings excluding some items may fall 3 percent to $1.14 a share, according to analysts’ average estimate. Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman has said a turnaround won’t happen anytime soon, and the company on Oct. 3 slashed its earnings forecast, sending shares to a 10-year low. “The innovation coming from those two companies has just been lackluster,” said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc. The PC makers’ stocks have been battered, which means investors aren’t paying much for already meager profit. Hewlett- Packard is trading at 3.3 times next year’s projected earnings and Dell at 5.5 times, among the cheapest companies among their peer group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone Ascent Dell rose 1.9 percent to $9.58 at the close in New York yesterday, trimming the year-to-date decline to 35 percent. Hewlett-Packard was little changed at $13.14, and the stock is down 49 percent this year. While PC sales languish, smartphone shipments of 488 million last year overtook the number of PCs shipped for the first time, according to market researcher Canalys. Sales of iPads and other tablets are forecast to increase 26 percent to $79.4 billion next year, according to NPD DisplaySearch. In notebooks -- the category the PC makers just a few years ago counted on for growth -- Apple has surpassed Hewlett-Packard as the top supplier in terms of revenue. To be sure, PCs aren’t going away any time soon. The industry will ship 348.7 million of them this year, according to IHS iSuppli. Microsoft’s Surface -- a hybrid tablet computer that converts into a small laptop -- has received mostly positive reviews. Tombstone Written “There are plenty of people who’ve already written the tombstone, and you could say that’s a bit premature,” said Michael Shinnick, a portfolio manager at Wasatch Advisors Inc. in South Bend, Indiana , which holds Dell shares. Windows 8, Microsoft’s much vaunted new software release, may be a mixed bag for the industry, though. Any new release of Windows spurs a wave of buying, which lifts all companies in the PC ecosystem. Yet many companies may eschew buying Windows 8 as they keep machines longer and are just now upgrading to the last version. Old alliances are splintering too: Microsoft’s recently released Surface tablet runs a version of Windows called RT built for chips made by ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) -- not its longtime partner Intel. And it competes directly with machines made by Hewlett-Packard, Dell and other electronics makers. Microsoft may have a hard time selling business users on Surface instead of the iPad if they don’t need its stalwart Office suite of productivity programs, said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. The machine and Windows 8 are designed around a revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that launch programs and update users with current information from the Internet. “If you don’t need Office, you don’t need Windows 8,” he said. “This is the concern everyone has about Microsoft right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at  aricadela@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "PC 시대의 종말이 다가오고 있다는 신호로, 어떤 기업들이 매출 감소를 경험하고 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "PC 시대의 종말이 다가오면서, 마이크로소프트, 델, 휴렛팩커드가 어떤 대응책을 내놓았나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "PC 시대의 종말이 다가오면서, PC 제조업체들이 직면한 도전과제는 무엇이며, 이를 극복하기 위한 전략은 무엇인가요?"}]}
{"headline": "Thaicom Gains Most in 18 Months on China Partner: Bangkok Mover", "article": "Thaicom Pcl (THCOM) , Thailand ’s satellite monopoly, gained the most in 18 months in Bangkok trading after saying it agreed to form a new partnership to help sell its high-speed Internet services in China. The shares surged 9.3 percent to 25.25 baht at the close, the biggest gain since July 2011. The stock was the third-best performer on the SET100 Index (SET100) , which rose 1.1 percent. Thaicom, controlled by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte, signed an initial agreement on Dec. 30 with a unit of Hong Kong- based Synertone Communication Corp. (1613) to become the new provider of its Ipstar services in China, according to a regulatory filing today. Thaicom has banked on higher revenue from its Ipstar satellite, an orbiter that offers high-speed Internet services, to return to profit after four years of annual losses. “The announcement is very positive for Thaicom because sales of Ipstar services in China have been very disappointing,” Chirasit Vuttigrai, an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand) Co. in Bangkok, said by telephone. “This raises optimism that the Ipstar business in China will significantly improve with the new partner.” Under the agreement, Synertone will become the sole provider of Ipstar service capacity available for mainland China, Thaicom said. The Chinese market accounts for about 24 percent of total capacity of its Ipstar satellite, it said. The orbiter is the company’s biggest satellite. Thaicom may buy an equity stake in Synertone, according to the Thai company. A final agreement between Thaicom and Synertone must be signed by March 31, it said. The partnership will enable Synertone to explore a new source of revenue and expand its customer base for specialized communication products, the company said in a separate statement on Dec. 30. Thaicom posted an annual loss every year between 2008 and 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had a profit of 50 million baht ($1.6 million) in the first nine months of 2012, compared with a net loss of 175.6 million baht in the same period a year earlier, it said Nov. 13.

This will help boost sentiments definitely.” “They still have concerns about inflation and property bubbles, but I think the larger concern has become stability of growth. If you don’t have overall macroeconomic stability, there is no point for you to try and control the housing market bubbles.

The government this time around is looking at both a short term boost and longer term structural adjustment. This is just the same as the structural stimulus that they have recently unveiled.” “Interest rate liberalization has been a topic that they have been discussing for such a long time and they want to incorporate that into this latest package as well, so that they are not just looking at short term stimuli but also longer term.

{"headline": "Czech Austerity Revolt Threatens Cabinet as Slump Bites", "article": "Czech Premier Petr Necas is battling to save his government as a revolt mounts against an austerity drive that threatens to deepen the nation’s recession. The 47-year-old lost his parliamentary majority in April when his coalition crumbled after budget and personnel rows. He must secure enough lower-house support to overturn last week’s Senate rejection of tax increases to cut the fiscal deficit below the European Union’s limit next year. The vote is likely to take place after parliament reconvenes in Prague on Sept. 4. Governments across Europe are struggling to hold on as austerity measures enacted to combat the euro-area debt crisis plunge their economies back into recession, four years after the start of the global financial crisis. The Czech economy has contracted for three quarters as Necas’s previous budget cuts curbed domestic demand and the debt crisis hurt exports. The lower house’s repeat vote “on this package will be, in a way, a vote about the government’s existence,” Jiri Pehe, a former adviser to late President Vaclav Havel and director of New York University in Prague, said by phone on Aug. 17. “It’s possible that Necas will link it to a confidence motion, or threaten early elections if the proposal isn’t approved, tactics he used before and that worked for him.” Maintaining Confidence Necas, who credits previous austerity measures with helping reduce borrowing costs, says his latest plan will maintain investor confidence by cutting the deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product next year through an increase in the sales tax and a levy on the highest incomes. Budget cuts are “an absolute priority” as the country risks higher borrowing costs if the fiscal strategy “loses credibility,” he said in an Aug. 18 interview with newspaper Lidove Noviny. Scrapping the tax increases would only be done by “a different government with a different premier,” he said. The yield on the two-year Czech bond fell to a record low of 0.513 percent today, about one-fifth what Italy pays to borrow for two years, according to generic data compiled by Bloomberg. The koruna slid 0.8 percent, the most among major emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, to 24.967 per euro by 2:10 p.m. in Prague. Deficit Cutting The two-year-old Cabinet has cut investment, raised the sales tax and curbed spending on public wages, helping to push the budget shortfall to 3.1 percent of GDP last year, from 4.8 percent in 2010. The $215 billion economy shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months, the third consecutive contraction , as households curbed spending in response to Europe’s worsening economy. The Czech Republic , which isn’t part of the 17-country euro region, relies on the 27-nation EU to buy 80 percent of exports, including from companies such as carmaker Skoda Auto AS. “The Czech economy is fundamentally healthier than most European economies, but it’s still lagging behind in performance,” Vaclav France, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank AS in Prague, said. “The government should be very cautious about austerity measures.” The Czech Republic, which joined the EU in 2004, expanded more than 5 percent for 13 quarters on an annual basis through 2007. Even with a spike in deficits following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, Czech public debt at 41 percent of GDP last year was about half of the EU average. Belgium , a euro-area member with about the same population and an economy more than twice as large, had debt of 98 percent of GDP and a deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011. Its two-year yield was 0.437 percent today. The Czech Republic has benefited from positive investor sentiment and a “solid track record of fiscal prudence” underpins its policy credibility, which keeps funding costs low, Moody’s Investors Service said in a note yesterday. ‘Credit Negative’ While the Cabinet is committed to cutting the deficit, “the unsupportive macroeconomic environment continues to hinder consolidation efforts and could jeopardize the stabilization of debt ratios, which would be credit negative,” said Moody’s, which rates the Czech Republic at A1. Apart from the opposition Social Democrats , the plan to raise taxes has also been criticized by President Vaclav Klaus, an economist who founded Necas’s Civic Democratic Party , or ODS, after the collapse of communism two decades ago, as well as the premier’s own lawmakers. Tax increases during a recession would further curtail economic growth and “border on economic suicide,” Klaus told newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes in an interview published Aug. 18. Necas shouldn’t “force deputies to vote in a way that would violate the long-standing program of the ODS,” which traditionally eschews tax increases, lawmaker Petr Tluchor said Aug. 17, according the CTK newswire. ‘Real Test’ Rejection of the proposed package “could result in a coalition breakup,” Jaromir Sindel , an economist at Citigroup Inc. in Prague, said by phone. The vote in the lower house will be a “real test of the coalition’s integrity,” Sindel said, expecting lawmakers to eventually approve the bill. Opposition to austerity measures has upended governments across Europe. The region’s three-year-old sovereign-debt crisis has resulted in the ouster of leaders in Ireland, Portugal , Greece , Italy, the Netherlands, Romania , Spain , Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. Private consumption will fall this year because of weak real disposable-income growth and negative sentiment , with full- year GDP to shrink 0.9 percent in 2012, the central bank forecasts. Retail sales declined in every month in the second quarter, while consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in almost 13 years in May, according to the statistics-office data. Weak Demand “We’ve been registering very weak household consumption in several recent quarters, and its growth rate seems to be the weakest in the modern history of the independent Czech Republic,” Vladimir Tomsik , a central bank vice-governor, said in an Aug. 15 interview. Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek, stepping up efforts to push through the austerity plan, last week evoked “nasty Wall Street imperialists” that will “dictate” policy to nations with irresponsible finances. “A country that loses access to the markets and to credit lines stops being sovereign and free,” he said during the Senate debate on the legislation. Number Crunching The Social Democrats have a majority in the Senate, with the ruling coalition holding 100 mandates in the 200-seat lower house. That’s one vote short of the majority needed to override Senate motions. While Necas doesn’t have clear backing from all his lawmakers for the tax increase, declining public support for the three ruling parties in opinion polls is adding to pressure on deputies to back his policies, according to Pehe. “There’s a number of politicians who know that if the government falls, their political existence is over,” Pehe said. “The likelihood of the government surviving is greater than that of it falling.” -- Editors: Jeffrey Donovan , Alan Crosby To contact the reporters on this story: Peter Laca in Prague at  placa@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "체코 정부의 긴축정책이 경제에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "체코 정부의 긴축정책이 투자자 신뢰에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "체코 정부의 긴축정책이 다른 유럽 국가들의 긴축정책과 비교하여 어떤 차이점과 유사점이 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "Ex-RBC, BofA Prop Traders to Start Mortgage Hedge Fund", "article": "Former Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America Corp. proprietary traders plan to start a mortgage hedge fund at New York-based Tandem Global Management LP next month, joining at least half-a-dozen money managers wagering that home-loan bonds will rise in value. Stuart Lippman, 40, chief investment officer of the Tandem Mortgage Opportunity Fund, was formerly a managing director and senior portfolio manager in the non-agency mortgage credit business of Royal Bank of Canada’s proprietary trading group, according to a presentation dated May 25 that was obtained by Bloomberg News. David Liu, 43, chief strategist and portfolio manager at the new fund, managed portfolios in the global proprietary trading group at Bank of America. The fund would focus primarily on U.S. non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage- backed securities and asset-backed securities, Lippman said in a telephone interview. He and Liu plan to start the fund at the end of July with $100 million and raise as much as $500 million in 12 to 18 months. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Hayman Capital Management LP, Cerberus Capital Management LP and Canyon Partners LLC are among firms that have started or are seeking money for pools to invest in U.S. residential mortgages without government backing. Declining prices of such bonds in 2011 lured funds to invest in the market, which paid off this year as values soared after European regulators sought to stem the sovereign-debt crisis and the Federal Reserve was able to sell $19.2 billion of the notes, underscoring demand. ‘Excellent Opportunity’ The $1.1 trillion market for bonds tied to U.S. residential mortgages that lack guarantees from government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or U.S.-owned Ginnie Mae gained 10.5 percent in the first five months of 2012 after losing 6.9 percent last year, according to Amherst Securities Group LP. “We view the opportunity set for smaller-sized managers in the space as extremely interesting at the moment,” Lippman said. “Since the end of the first quarter the market has experienced some retracement and dislocation providing entrants with an excellent opportunity set across asset types.” Before RBC, Lippman worked at UBS AG in the investment bank, where he built the secondary trading desk in both asset- backed securities and subprime mortgages, Tandem said in the presentation. Before that, he was a senior portfolio manager at Alliance Capital Management LP. Liu was head of mortgage credit research at UBS prior to his role at Bank of America. Before that, he was vice president of asset-backed securities research at Deutsche Bank AG. Lippman and Liu are currently fundraising for the fund. Lippman declined to say how much in assets Tandem has firmwide. Tandem was founded in 2008 by Kevin Murphy , Joe Petri and James Tammaro. The firm also has an emerging markets fund run by Ruggero de’ Rossi, partner and chief investment officer, it said in the presentation.

{"headline": "Ethanol Weakens Against Gasoline on Slack Use and Ample Supply", "article": "Ethanol futures in Chicago weakened against gasoline on reduced demand and ample supply. The additive’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 33.6 cents a gallon from 31.68 cents yesterday, based on December futures prices. Gasoline’s premium was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28. Ethanol stockpiles of 18.1 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 2 were 10 percent higher than a year earlier, according to Energy Department data released Nov. 7. Consumption of gasoline fell the most since Jan. 7, 2005, after Hurricane Sandy shut filling stations and kept drivers off the roads in the heavily populated U.S. Northeast. “The underlying fundamentals aren’t changing that much and that’s why the price isn’t changing that much,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines , Iowa. Denatured ethanol for December delivery climbed 0.6 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.343 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have risen 6.4 percent this year. Gasoline for December delivery advanced 2.52 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.679 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Corn for March delivery gained 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $7.2925 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Losing Money Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 29 cents on yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Companies have tempered production because of price declines. New Energy Corp., operator of an ethanol plant in South Bend , Indiana , filed for bankruptcy protection Nov. 9 with plans to sell its assets. Ethanol production has fallen 14 percent this year to 827,000 barrels a day, or 12.3 billion gallons on an annualized basis, as of Nov. 2, Energy Department data show. The agency plans to release supply data at 11 a.m. tomorrow in Washington , a day later than usual because of the Veterans Day holiday on Nov. 12. Ethanol prices “can’t go a lot lower or it shuts too much production and it can’t go too high because people would come online and produce too much,” Blackford said. “The market’s doing what it should be doing, which is staying flat.” Prices would rise if imports waned and demand from foreign buyers increased, he said. Ethanol exports in August, the most recent month for which data is available from the Energy Department, averaged 39,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since November 2010. The country became a net importer of ethanol in August for the first time since November 2010, according to the Energy Department.

The New York auctioneer earned $2.4 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.2 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier, it said in a statement. Revenue increased 17 percent to $119.6 million. The earnings were in line with estimates. Five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected profit of 3.6 cents a share.

{"headline": "The Senate Rises Above Politics (If Only in Fiction)", "article": "The phrase “the politics of personal destruction” entered the American lexicon during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Since 1998, it has become conventional wisdom that we are living through a uniquely vicious and polarized political period, a time when opponents no longer want to defeat each other, but to annihilate each other. Pundits speak of red and blue states as if a new Civil War was raging. Rumors and slanders that would once have been confined to the fringe -- such as the idea that President Obama is faking his birth certificate, or is secretly a Muslim -- enter mainstream discourse. One of the most commonly named symptoms of the breakdown of political civility is the polarization in the Senate. Once a chamber full of gentlemen and statesmen, the story goes, the Senate is today as bitterly partisan as the House. And the combination of Senate tradition with extreme politics is said to be producing an unprecedented gridlock. Senators place indefinite holds on presidential nominees. Most notably, the filibuster, once a rarely used piece of political theater, has become routine, meaning that 60 votes are now required to pass any major legislation in the Senate -- a supermajority that the Democrats briefly attained in 2009, and used to pass the Affordable Care Act. Beloved Washington It is all a long way from the world depicted in Allen Drury’s Pulitzer Prize-winning best-seller “Advise and Consent,” which was published in 1959. That novel shows that “the politics of personal destruction” are hardly a product of our own times. On the contrary, it tells the story of a virtuous senator driven to suicide by the scandal-mongering of his opponents. Yet Drury also depicts the Senate as a place of high ideals, jealous of its honor, where party divisions matter less than principles and friendships. Drury is in love with Washington , in a way that seems antique today, with politicians of all parties running as enemies of “the Beltway.” Drury loves to describe how a Senate quorum is called, what goes on at a Georgetown party, even how the Tidal Basin looks when the cherry blossoms come out. The plot of “Advise and Consent” centers on the president’s nomination of Robert Leffingwell to be secretary of state, and the novel follows four main characters and a host of subsidiary ones as they fight to confirm or defeat the nominee. In Leffingwell, a patrician liberal who got his start in politics as a New Dealer, there are strong echoes of Alger Hiss, whose career was similar. Soon enough the nominee is plunged into a confrontation with a Whittaker Chambers figure out of his past, who accuses him of having once been part of a Communist cell. Drury effectively weights the novel against Leffingwell, painting him as a wishy-washy peacenik who will jeopardize America’s resolve to fight back against Soviet aggression. The closest thing in the novel to an outright villain is Senator Fred Van Ackerman, a young, fire-breathing liberal who rallies support for Leffingwell by giving speeches of the better-dead- than-Red variety: Drury takes care to paint him as a demagogue verging on a psychotic. On the other hand, Leffingwell’s chief opponent, Seabright Cooley, is a long-serving Dixiecrat in the Strom Thurmond mold, who may be a racist and spoilsman, but whose heart is always shown to be in the right place. The spectrum of opinion mirrors that of the Democratic Party in the 1950s, but Drury goes out of his way not to use party labels. He writes only of “the majority party” and “the minority party,” a token of his belief that in the Senate, partisanship matters much less than principle and personal relationships. Deadly Secret Through a series of contrivances, the fate of the nomination comes to rest on the shoulders of Utah Senator Brigham Anderson, a widely admired young politician with a dangerous secret. Years earlier, during World War II, he had a gay love affair with a fellow soldier. Today, we are accustomed to thinking of the 1950s as the great age of repression and homophobia, but in “Advise and Consent” we find a best-selling novel that treats homosexuality with total sympathy, reserving all its condemnation for the gay-baiting politicians who would use it to destroy Anderson. Threatened with exposure unless he gives up his opposition to Leffingwell, Anderson commits suicide, becoming a martyr to prejudice and to the honor of the Senate. (Drury based this plot on the real-life case of Lester Hunt , who committed suicide in his Senate office in 1954, after political opponents threatened to publicize his son’s arrest for soliciting a male prostitute.) The driving force behind the blackmail of Anderson, it turns out, is the president himself. An unnamed figure who resembles the elusive Franklin Roosevelt more than the straightforward Dwight Eisenhower, the president is depicted in an ambiguous light that reflects Drury’s conflicted attitude toward power itself. Watching the president in action, the humble, Harry Truman-like vice president reflects: “This, he supposed, was greatness -- this ineffable combination of sincerity, insincerity, straightforwardness, duplicity, determination, adaptability and sheer downright guts. Thank God he wasn’t great, he told himself with a surge of innocent relief.” In another novel, the destruction of Anderson would be all you needed to know about the price of power and the ruthlessness of the powerful. Even Robert Penn Warren’s Willie Stark doesn’t do anything quite so loathsome. Yet Drury allows the senators of “Advise and Consent” a chance to reassert their basic decency and integrity, and to show another face of American politics: principled, nonpartisan and solely dedicated to the nation’s welfare. Van Ackerman, the persecutor of Anderson, is censured and effectively cast out of the Senate. Conscience Prevails When the Leffingwell nomination finally comes up for a vote, the majority leader instructs his followers to vote their conscience, not the party line. “The system had its problems, and it wasn’t exactly perfect,” Drury writes, “yet...there was a vigor and a vitality and a strength that nothing, he suspected, could ever quite overcome, no matter how evil and crafty it might be.” And in the novel’s last sequence, both parties and all branches of government rally together in the face of a threatening message from the Soviet Union , which -- in this post-Sputnik, pre-Apollo novel -- is supposed to have just landed the first man on the moon. Politics stops at the water’s edge, yet another old truth of American politics that today sounds antiquated, if not hypocritical. “Advise and Consent” concludes with a paean to “a few scraps of things, the memory of a meeting in Philadelphia, a speech at Gettysburg,” and other icons of American myth. Today, the noble individuals who populate Drury’s Senate seem similarly mythical -- relics of a bygone age that we will not recapture, no matter how much we miss it.

{"headline": "Kasparov Flees Russia on Detention Fears Amid Putin Crackdown", "article": "Garry Kasparov , the former chess world champion turned critic of President Vladimir Putin , has left Russia and said he won’t return for fear of being detained, days after a government adviser fled the country citing pressure from law enforcement. “Right now, I have serious doubts that I would be able to travel out again if I returned to Moscow,” Kasparov, leader of the opposition Solidarity group, said in audio recording on his website dated June 4 from Geneva, where he spoke at a human-rights event. “For the time being, I am refraining from returning to Russia.” In April, Kasparov scotched rumors of “his political death” and insisted he wasn’t leaving the country in a message on his Twitter Inc. account. Denis Bilunov, a spokesman for Kasparov and another leader of the Solidarity group, confirmed he’s no longer in Russia and has no plans to return. Kasparov joins a wave of departures by prominent economists and journalists after coming under scrutiny by investigators. Sergei Guriev, an associate of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and rector of the New Economic School in Moscow, fled Russia to avoid possible prosecution in a criminal case. Journalist Masha Gessen, who wrote a biography on Putin, said she was leaving Russia for New York with her three children. ‘Little Paranoid’ “Some people are getting scared because they are fearful of unpleasant people in the security services,” Mattias Westman, chief executive officer of Prosperity Capital Management Ltd., which oversees about $4.5 billion in Russian assets, said by mobile phone from London. “We don’t yet see a crackdown on businessmen but people are a little paranoid right now.” Another leading critic of Putin, Alexey Navalny, is on trial and faces as long as 10 years in prison over charges that he defrauded a state timber company. He denies any wrongdoing and says the case is payback for helping lead the biggest protests against Putin’s 13-year rule in 2011. Twelve people were indicted last month for mass rioting at a May 6, 2012 rally at Moscow’s Bolotnaya square on the eve of Putin’s inauguration, with closed court hearings scheduled to start today in the Russian capital. Putin, a former colonel in the KGB, reclaimed the presidency last year from Medvedev, who’d stood in for him for four years. As president, Medvedev pushed to lower the state’s presence in the economy and combat corruption. In January, Medvedev said he may run for the top post again when Putin’s third term ends in 2018. Three ministers in Medvedev’s Cabinet have been fired or forced out in the past seven months, most recently Deputy Prime Minister Vladislav Surkov , the government’s chief of staff.

{"headline": "Ex-Credit Suisse Broker Tzolov Ends Up With Four-Year Sentence", "article": "Julian Tzolov , a former Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) broker who fled prosecution before pleading guilty to securities fraud , was sentenced to four years in prison after initially getting a five-year term earlier in the day. Tzolov, 38, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York. He was accused of fraudulently selling securities that cost corporate clients more than $1.1 billion. Before sentence was passed, Tzolov said he regretted his decision to run away. “I have been going to bed at night and waking up every morning not being able to forgive myself, how I could let fear cloud my judgment and let down people who have been treating me honestly and professionally,” Tzolov told the judge. “I made the most colossal mistake of my life.” The judge cut the original five-year term after recalculating the penalty for bail jumping, according to Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Tzolov, and Robert Nardoza , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Tzolov, a native of Bulgaria , was returned to New York from Spain in July 2009 after fleeing for three months. Tzolov pleaded guilty when he returned to the U.S. and has been in custody since. He testified as a prosecution witness against Eric Butler, his former partner. The jury found Butler guilty in August 2009. Weinstein sentenced Butler, 39, in January 2010 to five years in prison. Butler is free on bail while he appeals his conviction. Weinstein sentenced Tzolov to 2 1/2 years for securities fraud, two conspiracy counts and seven wire-fraud counts. He added another 1 1/2 years, to run consecutively, for bail jumping. He granted probation for a count of immigration fraud. ‘Clearly Disappointed’ “I understand the sentence,” Brafman said after the initial hearing. “I’m clearly disappointed but we’ll deal with it.” Brafman had asked Weinstein to sentence his client to time served. He told Weinstein that his client has essentially been in isolation for two years because he has no family in the U.S. Tzolov, wearing a blue prison uniform, broke down in tears while discussing his 89-year-old father who is ill and “is in the last stage of his life.” In pleading guilty, Tzolov said he and Butler intentionally misled clients about securities purchased on their behalf, falsely claiming they were backed by federally guaranteed student loans. The men told clients the investments, actually backed by riskier corporate debt and subprime mortgages, were a safe alternative to bank deposits or money-market funds, said prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn. ‘Substantial Assistance’ Prosecutors in a filing yesterday asked for leniency for Tzolov because of his “substantial assistance,” including his aid in convicting Butler. “This defendant did cooperate and effectively laid out the fraud that was committed and the fact that the banks and their customers have closed their eyes to their obligations to the public,” Weinstein said in sentencing Tzolov. “Credit Suisse was careless in supervising various people.” David Walker , a spokesman for Zurich-based Credit Suisse, declined to comment. Weinstein also ordered Tzolov to pay $1.11 million in restitution to victims and $250,000 in forfeiture to the government. Tzolov and Butler worked as partners in Credit Suisse’s corporate cash management group, a division that helped clients manage excess corporate cash holdings, according to court papers. They routinely falsified the names of the securities they put their clients in by, for example, adding “ed” or “student loan” and deleting “housing,” according to prosecutors. Higher Commissions The brokers earned higher commissions from selling securities backed by corporate debt and mortgages than from selling those backed by student loans. Their clients included GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and STMicroelectronics NV. (STM)  Butler and Tzolov were allowed to keep $4.45 million in signing bonuses under a July 2010 arbitration ruling lost by their former employer, Morgan Stanley (MS) , at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The two men joined New York-based Morgan Stanley after leaving Credit Suisse. The cases are U.S. v.

{"headline": "Hedge Funds Ask SEC to Let Them Solicit Private Funds Without Registration", "article": "The Managed Funds Association is urging U.S. regulators to remove restrictions on solicitation and advertising in private offerings to make it easier for hedge funds to raise money and promote their products. The Securities and Exchange Commission should amend its rules to allow private funds to “engage in communication and offering activity while remaining in compliance,” Richard H. Baker, the Washington-based lobby group’s president and chief executive officer, said in a letter requesting the rule change. An SEC advisory group on small and emerging companies voted for a similar recommendation on Jan. 6. The change would let hedge funds avoid the SEC’s registration process while openly seeking money from so-called accredited investors, those deemed sophisticated enough to understand riskier offerings. Changes in securities markets and regulations have rendered the 30-year-old restrictions unnecessary, Baker wrote in the letter dated yesterday. “We believe eliminating the ban would reduce the cost of capital for private funds and lead to greater efficiency in private offerings,” Baker wrote. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro asked her staff to rethink the measure after President Barack Obama directed federal agencies last year to ensure their rules promote economic growth while using the least burdensome tools to achieve regulatory ends. The U.S. House of Representatives in November approved legislation proposed by California Republican Kevin McCarthy that would let closely held companies advertise for investors. A similar measure awaits action by the Senate. “The industry is viewed as secretive, creating an unwarranted negative inference by investors and regulators,” Baker said. Removing curbs on advertising and solicitation would be “an important step in allowing a wider audience to learn about the industry,” he said.

{"headline": "ICICI Among Indian Banks That Face Moody’s Downgrade", "article": "ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , HDFC Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) were placed under review for a downgrade of their financial strength rating by Moody’s Investors Service as the lenders are currently above India’s sovereign debt rating. The review will take into account the banks’ cross-border diversification of operations and their domestic sovereign debt holdings, among other factors, Moody’s said in a statement today. Most banks globally will be rated at the same grade as the nation where they are based, the ratings company said. India is rated at Baa3, the lowest investment-grade level. India’s sovereign credit outlook was lowered this month to negative by Standard & Poor’s , taking the nation a step closer to junk status and dealing a further blow to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ’s economic agenda. S&P reaffirmed its BBB- long- term India rating, while citing concerns that economic growth has slowed and the current-account deficit has widened. “Moody’s believes that the creditworthiness of financial institutions with low cross-border operational diversification and/or high balance-sheet exposures to the debt of their domestic sovereign is closely linked to that sovereign’s credit strength,” according to the statement today. Such lenders “are unlikely to have standalone credit assessments above the sovereign.” Economy Falters India’s economic expansion moderated to 6.1 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the slowest pace in almost three years, as costlier credit hurt consumer spending and dented investment. The slowdown sapped tax receipts even as subsidies and a job- guarantee program for rural workers fanned spending. ICICI, HDFC (HDFCB) and Axis currently have standalone financial strength ratings, or baseline credit assessments of C-/Baa2, Moody’s said. The review of those ratings may take about three months, the credit assessor. The debt and deposit ratings for all three banks are unaffected, according to the statement. ICICI, India’s second-largest lender by assets, rose 1.6 percent to 882.35 rupees at close in Mumbai. HDFC, the country’s second-largest bank by market value, fell 0.2 percent to 542.5 rupees and Axis declined 1.3 percent to 1,106.95 rupees. The BSE India Bankex Index (BANKEX) , a gauge for 14 Indian lenders, rose by 0.6 percent. “The rating action by Moody’s is not a change in the sovereign rating of India and not affect ratings of any instruments issued by ICICI Bank,” including bonds or deposits, ICICI said in an e-mailed statement today. “Our ALM is well matched with asset repayments in fiscal 2012-13 broadly covering our bond and loan repayment obligations.” ALM refers to the asset-liability mix. “We do not need to access bond markets for refinancing,” the Mumbai-based lender said in the statement. “We will look at accessing the markets to raise funds for new lending depending on the cost and the rates at which we can deploy the funds.” HDFC spokesman Neeraj Jha and Axis spokesman Julius Samson declined to comment immediately when contacted.

{"headline": "PPR Said to Explore Leveraged Buyout Financing for Conforama", "article": "PPR SA is exploring financing options for Conforama, including arranging a loan to finance a potential leveraged buyout to attract private-equity bidders, as it weighs a sale of France’s second-largest furniture retailer, said four people with knowledge of the matter. The Paris-based company is asking lenders to make proposals for a so-called staple financing that could be used to fund a Conforama LBO by private-equity firms, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified because the talks are confidential. PPR values the business at about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion), a person familiar with the matter said in June. PPR, which also owns mail-order retailer Redcats and the Fnac music and video-store chain, is seeking to sell its retail assets to focus on building its luxury and lifestyle businesses. PPR may acquire more brands to bolster its Puma and Gucci Group divisions after selling “one or two” of the retail units, Chief Executive Officer Francois-Henri Pinault said yesterday. Conforama will hold presentations and discuss business plans with the lenders in the coming weeks, the people said. PPR will make a decision on whether to proceed with a Conforama sale by the middle of next month, one of the people said. PPR has also asked banks to explore a recapitalization to pay a dividend or a way to monetize the furniture retailer’s real estate assets, two of the people said. No Discussions Colony Capital LLC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS Capital Partners and Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd. have expressed interest in the unit, people familiar with the matter said in June. Marne-La-Vallée, France-based Conforama, which sells products including sofas, lamps, freezers and televisions, has a value of about 1.3 billion euros, Luca Solca , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, estimated in a Sept. 30 report. Colony Capital and GS Capital Partners bought a controlling stake in BUT, France’s third-largest furniture retailer, in January 2008 and have sought to combine the business with Conforama, three people familiar with the matter said in June. Steinhoff, Africa’s largest furniture maker, is looking for opportunities in France, said Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste in a June 11 interview. Conforama , which operates 239 stores worldwide, the majority of which are in France, focuses on the mass discount market. More Profitable Charlotte Judet, a spokeswoman for PPR, declined to comment on any possible interest in Conforama. A spokeswoman for Colony and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Mariza Nel , a spokeswoman for Steinhoff, said the company doesn’t comment on speculation. While PPR aims to sell at least one retail unit this year, it isn’t in a hurry and won’t sell assets cheaply, Pinault said May 19. The disposals might happen this year or next, he said at the time. Conforama’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 32 percent to 83 million euros in the first six months of 2010 as sales rose 6.2 percent, PPR said in July. The furniture retailer will be “significantly” more profitable this year than last year, Conforama CEO Thierry Guibert said in a June 30 interview.

{"headline": "Biogen Second-Quarter Profit Rises as Avonex Sales Increase", "article": "Biogen Idec Inc., the third-largest U.S. biotechnology company, reported profit that topped analysts’ estimates as sales increased from its top-selling multiple sclerosis medicine Avonex and cancer therapy Rituxan. Second-quarter net income surged 34 percent to $386.8 million, or $1.61 a share, from $288 million, or $1.18, a year earlier, the Weston, Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement. Earnings excluding some items of $1.82 topped by 26 cents the average of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue beat estimates by about $90 million. Biogen said profit this year is expected to be more than $6.20 a share, 5 cents higher than its May 1 forecast. The company has been increasing sales of Avonex, Rituxan and Tysabri, another MS therapy, while developing new medicines to introduce to the market. “The quarter looks terrific, probably one of the stronger quarters you’ll see in this earnings season,” Eric Schmidt , an analyst with Cowen & Co., said in a telephone interview today. “It’s a blowout quarter, driven by the top line.” Biogen rose less than 1 percent to $139.48 at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have gained 27 percent this year. Sales Jump Revenue in the quarter rose 18 percent to $1.42 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.33 billion. Sales of Avonex climbed 16 percent to $762 million, while Rituxan increased 31 percent to $285 million. Tysabri revenue was little changed at $280 million, Biogen said. The company’s first pill for MS, BG-12, is being weighed for approval by regulators in the U.S. and Europe , and late- stage data are expected this year on experimental medicines being developed for Lou Gehrig ’s disease and hemophilia. “In the next six months, we go into a really interesting period for Biogen Idec where the pre-launch activity for these late-stage programs intensifies,” Paul Clancy, Biogen’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview today. “We’re in this unique situation where the company is blessed with four pivotal readouts over the next nine months, and we’re doing commercial preparations.” To contact the reporter on this story: Meg Tirrell in New York at  mtirrell@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at  rgale5@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "바이오젠 아이덱의 주요 수익 창출 의약품은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "바이오젠 아이덱의 수익성 개선이 기업 가치와 투자자 기대에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "바이오젠 아이덱의 신약 개발 파이프라인과 시장 진입 전략이 경쟁우위와 장기 성장 전망에 어떤 영향을 줄 수 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "Euro-Region Slowdown Caused Overreaction, Estonia’s Kaasik Says", "article": "Investors “overreacted” to signs the euro region’s economic recovery is losing momentum as data have yet to confirm the situation is worsening, Estonian central bank Deputy Governor Ulo Kaasik said. Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the least since the region emerged from recession in 2009. It’s too early to say whether the developments of the financial markets in recent weeks will affect the economy, Kaasik said in an interview in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, yesterday. “The euro region’s recovery has been fast and faster than what was expected a year ago,” Kaasik said. “Now, when growth has slowed in the second quarter, it has somehow surprised the markets which have overreacted in a negative way. In fact, we don’t have clear data showing that the situation is worsening.” The second-quarter growth figure compared with 0.8 percent expansion in the first quarter and a 0.3 percent median estimate of 34 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Economic growth is slowing around the globe. The Federal Reserve this month pledged to keep interest rates near zero for another two years to bolster a recovery that’s moving “considerably slower” than expected. European policy makers are struggling to contain a debt crisis, while Japan has cut its annual growth forecast on weaker export prospects. ‘Significant’ Risks Given recent developments, a worse-than-expected development of the euro area’s economy can’t be ruled out as “risks are significant and there is a lot of uncertainty,” said Kaasik, 36. Kaasik and Madis Muller, a former fund manager with the World Bank , were appointed in May as deputy central bank governors for five-year terms, replacing Marten Ross and Rein Minka. Estonia adopted the euro in January, with Governor Andres Lipstok becoming a voting member of the European Central Bank council. European stocks rebounded from a two-year low yesterday amid speculation the Federal Reserve may this week signal additional stimulus measures. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent to 224.9 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge retreated 6.1 percent last week, extending its decline from this year’s high to 23 percent. The four-week rout in equities has wiped out more than $8 trillion in global stock values before central bankers from around the world prepare to meet in Jackson Hole , Wyoming. Estonia’s euro adoption has had a “certain” role in boosting growth to 8.4 percent in the first half from a year earlier, the European Union’s fastest, and increasing investor confidence, Kaasik said. CDS Spreads The $19 billion economy started expanding in the second quarter of 2010 following its deepest recession in two decades, on demand for its products from Sweden and Finland. Exports grew 43 percent from a year earlier in June, the slowest pace in four months, the statistics office said earlier this month. Five-year Estonian credit-default swaps traded at 125 points on Aug. 19, while the spread to Latvia’s CDS has increased to 133 points from 112 points before the turmoil on global markets, according to data from CMA. The spread to Lithuania’s CDS has increased to 132 points from 110. “Markets view Estonia more positively as the CDS spreads with our neighbors Latvia and Lithuania are increasing,” Kaasik said. “Our CDS prices have increased by similar magnitude as those of Sweden and Finland, while Latvia’s and Lithuania’s have clearly risen more.” To contact the reporter on this story: Ott Ummelas in Tallinn at  oummelas@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at  bpenz@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "유로 지역 경제 회복이 둔화되고 있다는 신호에 대해 투자자들이 과잉반응한 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "유럽중앙은행 정책 결정자들이 부채 위기를 억제하기 위해 어떤 조치를 취할 수 있을까?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "글로벌 경제 성장 둔화가 개별 기업과 섹터의 리스크-리턴 구조에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까?"}]}
{"headline": "Uganda Is Losing U.S.-Backed Fight Against LRA Rebels, Rights Watch Says", "article": "U.S. support for Ugandan troops in their fight against the Lord’s Resistance Army has failed after the campaign led the rebels to spread into neighboring countries, Human Rights Watch said today. The New York-based rights group called on the U.S. to propose a regional solution that would protect civilians and target the LRA’s leaders, according to an e-mailed statement. The U.S. will release a new strategy document later this month. “The LRA’s top leaders can be found, but the current strategy of supporting Ugandan army operations is clearly not working,” said Human Rights Watch senior Africa researcher Anneke Van Woudenberg. “A new approach is needed to protect civilians and to bring together improved intelligence and capable units to apprehend the LRA’s top leaders.” Since 2007, the LRA has killed about 2,000 civilians in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congolese and Ugandan armies are conducting joint operations against the group with support from United Nations peacekeepers. The offensive has pushed the rebels into remote parts of Congo, Central African Republic and Southern Sudan. President Barack Obama signed legislation in May to create a new strategy “to eliminate the threat to civilians and regional stability” posed by the LRA. The strategy will be announced by Nov. 24, according to the law. U.S. Response In an e-mailed statement, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the Ugandan army “remained the most effective national military pursuing the LRA.” The army has “significantly degraded the capabilities of the LRA, has conducted itself well, and has reduced the ability of the organization to abduct and hold captives,” the statement said. Only about 200 to 400 LRA rebels remain along with hundreds of abductees, according to Human Rights Watch. Uganda’s army has battled a two-decade insurgency in the north of the country by the LRA. The group, led by Joseph Kony , started fighting after Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in the 1980s purged the army of members of the Acholi community, whose interests the LRA says it is defending. Kony, a former Catholic altar boy who says the LRA is inspired by the Ten Commandments, faces International Criminal Court charges of murder, mutilation, rape and the abduction of thousands of children for use as soldiers. Kony is now thought to be on the border between Central African Republic and Sudan’s Darfur region, Human Rights Watch said. The group also called on the UN to deploy more peacekeepers to LRA-affected areas. To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Kavanagh in Kinshasa  mkavanagh9@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Pakistan Taliban’s Deputy Chief Killed in Drone Attack, WSJ Says", "article": "The deputy commander of the Pakistani Taliban movement has been killed in a U.S. drone strike in the country’s tribal regions bordering Afghanistan , the Wall Street Journal reported, citing officials it didn’t name. Wali-ur-Rehman died in North Waziristan, the paper said in the first drone attack since the May 11 general election in Pakistan. Three Pakistani security officials and residents confirmed the killing, it reported without identifying them. A Taliban spokesman called the reports false, the Associated Press said. Prime Minister-designate Nawaz Sharif is scheduled to begin a third term in office next week and has vowed to open peace talks with the Taliban in a bid to end their insurgency. Along with other Pakistani leaders, Sharif has called for an end to drone attacks in the tribal area, saying the civilian casualties they cause help the guerrillas recruit support. Pakistan said in a statement it was concerned “over the U.S. drone attack that occurred in North Waziristan” today. “The drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty,” the foreign ministry in Islamabad said in the statement without commenting on reports of Wali-ur-Rehman’s death. U.S. President Barack Obama said May 23 that his country will reduce the number of attacks by the pilotless aircraft in countries where it is fighting Islamist extremists and would tighten the rules governing who can be targeted. The U.S. military, instead of the Central Intelligence Agency, will be the lead authority for drone strikes, administration officials said. $5 Million Officials at the media unit of Pakistan’s army didn’t immediately return calls seeking details of today’s drone strike. The U.S. in 2010 announced a bounty of $5 million each on Wali-ur-Rehman and the chief of Pakistan’s Taliban insurgency, Hakimullah Mehsud. It has also urged Pakistan’s army to extend offensives against the Taliban and allied militants to parts of North Waziristan from where guerrillas attack U.S. and Afghan forces across the border.

{"headline": "Global Demand for U.S. Assets Unexpectedly Weakens as China Trims Holdings", "article": "Global demand for U.S. long-term financial assets such as government bonds slowed in March as investors shifted into shorter-term securities and China trimmed its portfolio of Treasuries. Net buying of long-term equities, notes and bonds totaled $24 billion during the month, compared with net buying of $27.2 billion in February, according to statistics issued today in Washington. Including short-term securities such as stock swaps, foreigners purchased a net $116 billion, compared with net buying of $95.6 billion the previous month. The Treasury’s reporting on long-term securities helps gauge confidence in the U.S. economy as well as fiscal and monetary policy. The data capture international purchases of government notes and bonds, stocks, corporate debt and securities issued by U.S. agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which buy home mortgages. “Foreigners had a little more confidence in the recovery in March,” and they shifted into swaps, equities and riskier assets from Treasury securities, said Kevin Chau, a foreign exchange strategist at IDEAglobal in New York. China remained the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, after its holdings fell by $9.2 billion to $1.145 trillion in March from $1.154 trillion in February, according to the Treasury’s statistics. Japan , Hong Kong  Japan, the second-largest holder, increased its holdings by $17.6 billion to $907.9 billion in March from $890.3 billion in February. Hong Kong, counted separately from China, reduced its holdings by $2.5 billion to $122.1 billion in March from $124.6 billion in February. Before today’s report was issued by the Treasury, economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected long-term U.S. financial assets would show net buying of $33 billion in March. Seven economists participated in the survey, and their estimates ranged from $10 billion to $45 billion. Total foreign purchases of Treasury notes and bonds were $26.8 billion in March compared with purchases of $30.6 billion in February. Foreign demand for U.S. agency debt from companies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac registered net buying of $9.49 billion in March after selling of $1.49 billion in February. Net foreign purchases of equities were $14.7 billion in March after net purchases of $6.1 billion in February. Investors purchased a net $3.77 billion in U.S. corporate debt in March after selling $2.54 billion in February. Slower Than Forecast In the first quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a slower- than-forecast annual rate of 1.8 percent as government spending declined by the most since 1983, according to Commerce Department statistics released April 28. In the fourth quarter of last year, gross domestic product grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate. In emerging European economies, public finances have “sharply deteriorated” and banks are burdened by “large numbers” of nonperforming loans, the International Monetary Fund said in a report May 12. The European Union and the IMF were forced to organize bailouts for Greece and Ireland last year and are preparing a rescue plan for Portugal. China and the U.S. remain at odds over foreign exchange policy. After meetings last week in Washington , Chinese Deputy Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said the U.S. and China agree that the yuan should be allowed to strengthen. However, “the view from the U.S. side is that the yuan should rise continuously at a faster appreciation pace,” Zhu said. “We have differences on the degree of appreciation.” To contact the reporters on this story: Vincent Del Giudice in Washington at Or vdelgiudice@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미국의 장기 금융자산에 대한 글로벌 수요가 감소하는 상황에서, 투자자들이 단기 증권으로 이동하는 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "중국이 미국 국채 포트폴리오를 축소한 것이 미국 경제에 대한 신뢰도에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "미국의 경제 성장률이 예상보다 낮은 상황에서, 신흥 유럽 경제의 공공재정과 은행의 부실채권 문제가 글로벌 금융시장에 미칠 수 있는 잠재적 영향은 무엇인가요?"}]}
{"headline": "Levine on Wall Street: The Business of Private Equity Is Business", "article": "Is private equity a business ? A private equity firm buys a bunch of different companies that make different sorts of widgets and then owns and manages them. In the olden days you'd have called this a \"conglomerate.\" If you asked the chief executive officer of a conglomerate what his company did, he'd say \"oh we make military aircraft and mining equipment and toasters and clothes for dogs\" or whatever. If you ask the CEO of a private equity firm what his company does, he'll say \"we're investors.\" But basically same thing. But it matters: A Boston court in a pension case recently ruled that Sun Capital Partners, a private equity fund, is \"engaged in a trade or business,\" not just an investor, under pension funding laws. The scary risk for private equity would be if the Internal Revenue Service applies this reasoning to tax law, which would expose private equity funds and their investors both to more taxes and more interactions with the IRS. Which is not really what they're into. More here. Should bankers get bigger bonuses ? Britain sued in the European Court of Justice to try to overturn the European Union rules that would limit bankers' bonuses to twice their base pay, arguing that this would force banks to raise base pay and thus have higher fixed costs, which would make them riskier in an economic downturn. This is quite right as far as it goes: The system of paying bankers and traders mostly in once-a-year discretionary lump sums probably does make banks structurally more stable. On the other hand the argument is that it makes them culturally riskier: A person who works all year for a shot at a once-a-year discretionary lump sum is a person who is comfortable taking on a lot of risk. You gotta weigh the fact that paying big bonuses makes banks safer in a crisis, against the possibility that it makes them more likely to have crises. Can JPMorgan make it stop ?  The number for JPMorgan Chase's global mortgage-bond maybe settlement is up to $11 billion, \"including $4 billion for consumer relief.\" The $11 billion means nothing, it was $3 billion a few days ago, it's still ongoing, it'll be a trillion dollars by Monday, I dunno. The consumer relief stuff is interesting: As far as I can tell, this settlement is addressed exclusively to claims that JPMorgan ripped off investors in mortgages, by lending those investors' money to people who weren't going to pay it back. Giving $4 billion of the settlement money to people who got loans and now can't pay them back seems sort of backwards. But oh whatever it's all mortgage badness let's throw billions of dollars at it why not. Stock exchanges might have a backup plan NYSE and Nasdaq have had some technical difficulties recently, as you might have heard, and are now discussing a solution where each backs up the other's pricing data feeds so that if one exchange goes down its stocks can be traded on the other exchange. It is a little weird that this can't happen now: After all, pretty much every stock is traded on multiple exchanges, besides its home listing exchange, so when the home exchange goes down for repairs you'd think you could just trade the stock on the other exchanges. But, nope : those data feeds, run by the home exchanges, turn out to be critical. You can't trade a Nasdaq-listed stock on the Philadelphia Exchange, say, while Nasdaq is down, because without the data feeds you don't know what the trading price is on the Pacific Exchange, and securities rules require you to trade at the best price nationwide. This interconnectedness of exchanges is what makes technical difficulties at NYSE and Nasdaq so damaging. But maybe it can be solved by more interconnectedness.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "사모펀드가 '투자자'가 아닌 '사업체'로 간주될 경우, 어떤 법적, 세무적 영향을 받을 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "은행가들의 보너스 제한이 은행의 안정성과 위험성 관리에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "JP모건의 모기지 채권 관련 합의금이 소비자 구제 목적으로 사용되는 것이 적절한지, 그리고 이러한 합의가 금융 시장의 안정성과 투자자 보호에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을지 분석해보세요."}]}
{"headline": "California Can Cut Medi-Cal Reimbursements, Court Rules", "article": "California can cut reimbursement rates for medical-care providers in Medi-Cal, the state health program for the poor, a federal appeals court ruled, overturning a lower-court judge who had blocked the reductions. The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco today said the California Department of Health Care Services and U.S. Health and Human Services secretary acted properly in reviewing and approving the cuts. U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder said last year that the hospital groups and service providers who sued to stop the reductions were likely to succeed. “The secretary’s approval of California’s requested reimbursement rates, including her permissible view that prior to reducing rates states need not follow any specific procedural steps, such as considering providers’ costs, is entitled to deference,” the appellate panel said. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last year approved the proposal to reduce Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. The cuts were part of the state’s 2011-12 budget and were expected to save $623 million, according to an Oct. 27, 2011, statement by the Department of Health Care Services. The California Hospital Association said in its complaint that the cuts of more than 20 percent would mark a return to rates that courts have found violate the federal Medicaid Act. The reductions would threaten the ability of many hospitals to operate skilled nursing units, the group said. ‘Fiscal Crisis’ “The state’s fiscal crisis does not outweigh the serious irreparable injury the plaintiffs would suffer absent the issuance of an injunction,” Snyder said in her ruling last year. In a separate decision, the lower-court judge had also blocked the state from cutting Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for pharmacies by 10 percent, saying that there was enough evidence pharmacies may have to reduce services or close, and that Medi- Cal beneficiaries would lose access to drugs. Both the hospital and pharmacy cuts were to be retroactive to June 1, 2011. Jan Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Association, said in a phone interview that the group is reviewing the ruling and hasn’t decided yet what its next step will be. “We are certainly disappointed,” Emerson-Shea said. “We are very concerned about access to care.” Hospitals that operate skilled nursing units that provide complex medical care for elderly patients won’t be able to absorb the lower rates as they’re already reimbursed by Medi-Cal below their costs, Emerson-Shea said. Some hospitals may be forced to close these units outright, she said. The case is Managed Pharmacy Care v. Sebelius, 12-55067, U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit (San Francisco.)

{"headline": "Blind Dissident Has China's Tweeters Seeing Red", "article": "On Wednesday evening, Exercise Book, a user of the Sina Weibo microblog, posted a message for his 2.5 million followers: “I’ve finally figured out where the safest place in China is…” The message was anything but cryptic. Only hours earlier, state-run Chinese media began reporting what much of the world had known for almost a week : Legal activist Chen Guangcheng, who is also blind, had escaped from house arrest in Shandong Province and was granted refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Chinese netizens were quick to jump on the startling news, and by 8:00 a.m. on Thursday, they’d posted more than 4,500 comments to Exercise Book’s Weibo post. At least a third of the responses speculated where the safest place in China was, with the vast majority guessing the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. As subtle, uncensored rejoinders to Chinese official statements go, this was powerful. Nonetheless, Exercise Book and his followers likely didn't see the U.S. as a proverbial “ beacon of hope .” Rather, like other netizens across China ’s microblogging platforms, they were using the best means available to criticize the Chinese Communist Party and government. To be sure, parsing Chinese public opinion from the country’s fractious but tightly regulated and censored microblogs is a tenuous act. Chinese microbloggers represent the most educated and wealthiest strata of society, and less than one third of the Chinese population. Meanwhile, microblog censors -– at the behest of Chinese internet authorities -– delete posts perceived as harmful to the party and government while restricting searches on sensitive topics. Therefore, the name “Chen Guangcheng,” and terms that might be associated with him, such as “blind lawyer,” do not bring up results. In the case of Chen Guangcheng , that’s convenient: He is not a household name in China and very few netizens appear to be familiar with his activism against forced sterilizations and abortions that led to years of persecution and home detention. His daring escape to Beijing, followed by his refuge at the U.S. embassy and the ensuing  diplomatic tussle , have not created big news in China. State-run coverage of Chen has mainly focused on his presence at the embassy , with some criticism of the U.S. -- and a little schadenfreude at its current diplomatic predicament. But as stripped down as those official Chinese reports are, they seem to have struck a nerve with a sizable number of Chinese netizens who re-tweet them -– and comment on them -- by the thousands. (Note: Censors, for the moment, give comment threads wider latitude than actual posts, or tweets.) On Wednesday afternoon, Xinhua, China’s state-owned news agency, posted a Chen-related message to its official Sina Weibo account: By Thursday morning, that tweet had been re-posted more than 6,000 times and garnered nearly 2,000 comments -– many of which jumped on the suggestion that the U.S. “reflect.” One of the most biting responses was from an anonymous microblogger in Hangzhou, who suggested that Chinese behavior toward Chen Guangcheng is the real threat to U.S.-China relations. It’s a devastating critique that, if posted separate from a comment thread, would almost certainly be deleted: Nonetheless, from an official Chinese perspective, there’s a big difference between criticizing individual government officials' decisions, and criticizing the structure and legitimacy of the Communist Party and its government. As this second Chen-related post from Xinhua showed, the former is occasionally tolerated and the latter is not: This has received 2,000 re-tweets and 35 comments. Any attempt to add a new comment to the 35 is met with the message: “Sorry, the content is in violation of relevant regulations and policies and cannot be published.” The message, for netizens, is clear: Do not criticize the system. Critical comments on the Foreign Ministry’s views on the rule of law in China exist on microblogs, but they are reserved for the actions of individual officials. For example, the independent Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper in Guangzhou posted the same news to its Sina Weibo account, but received comments such as this scathing one from a user with the English-language handle GhostInTheHell: Answers to those questions won’t come soon, but it’s also unlikely that the questions will stop. China’s netizens are becoming savvier about their news, their rulers and the role they play in making the latter responsive to the former. Wednesday night, NB Jianbo , an entrepreneur in Ningbo, a boomtown south of Shanghai, summarized that new role in an affecting tweet that referenced news about Chen Guangcheng and several additional “sensitive” news stories from recent weeks: So far, there are five comments to this post. The second is the most eye-catching, however. It technically reads: “The Communist Party won’t let us be patriotic.” But in place of the characters for Communist Party, it uses a small hammer and sickle character.

{"headline": "Weight Training May Help Lower Diabetes Risk in Men", "article": "Weight training alone or with aerobic exercise may lower diabetes risk in men, Harvard University research showed, while a German study found that physical activity keeps those with the disease alive longer. Lifting weights 30 minutes a day, five times a week, may reduce a man’s chance of developing Type 2 diabetes by as much as 34 percent, and when combined with aerobic exercise like brisk walking or running, cuts the risk as much as 59 percent, according to the Harvard research posted online today in the Archives of Internal Medicine. The German study showed that people with diabetes who were moderately active had a 38 percent lower risk of dying compared with those who didn’t exercise. The Harvard study is the largest on the benefits of weight training and aerobic activity on diabetes, while the German research is the biggest to look at exercise and mortality in diabetics, the authors said. More studies are needed to find better ways to motivate people to exercise, said Mitchell Katz , director of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. “How to increase motivation to stay active is the $1 million question facing physicians and health care experts and not just because of diabetes,” Katz said in an Aug. 5 e-mail. “A number of diseases including cardiac disease, the most common cause of death in the U.S., and cancer, the second-most common,” are reduced through exercise, he said. About 346 million people worldwide have Type 2 diabetes, and diabetes-related deaths may double between 2005 and 2030, according to the World Health Organization. 150 Minutes In the study from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Southern Denmark, the researchers looked at 32,002 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1990 to 2008. During that time 2,278 men developed diabetes. Men who did weight training one to 59 minutes a week reduced their diabetes risk by 12 percent, those who engaged in weight training 60 to 149 minutes a week reduced their risk by 25 percent and those who weight trained for at least 150 minutes a week lowered it by 34 percent compared with those who did no weight training, the authors said. Combining 150 minutes a week of weight training with 150 minutes of aerobic exercise reduced diabetes risk by 59 percent. “When we use our muscles as in weight training our body’s insulin resistance goes down meaning we more readily move blood sugar from the bloodstream into the cells and we require less insulin to do that so that the blood sugar levels stay lower and put less demand on the pancreas to produce insulin,” said Walter Willett, the author of the first study and chair of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. Couch Consequences “The more we paint the full picture of the consequences of staying on the couch, the more people we are likely to motivate to put some activity into their lives,” Willett said in an Aug. 3 telephone interview. “This is looking at one part of the picture -- diabetes -- but more importantly to people, even a few minutes a day of strength training it can make an important difference. There are immediate benefits of feeling better.” The second study, led by researchers from the German Institute of Human Nutrition in Nuthetal, looked prospectively at 5,859 patients with diabetes and found that those who engaged in moderate amounts of exercise were at a lower risk of death compared with those who were inactive. In an analysis of 12 studies, the researchers found that higher levels of total physical activity, leisure-time physical activity and walking were related to a lower risk of overall mortality and death from heart diseases. “Compared with being inactive, being moderately active may already improve survival in persons with diabetes,” said Diewertje Sluik, the lead study author and a doctor of public health with the nutrition institute, in an e-mail today. “Unfortunately, not many diabetes patients engage in regular physical activity. Therefore, it is necessary to promote active lifestyles among persons with diabetes and future research should determine why persons do not adhere to this advice.” To contact the reporter on this story: Nicole Ostrow in New York at  nostrow1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at  rgale5@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "웨이트 트레이닝과 유산소 운동이 제2형 당뇨병 발병 위험에 어떤 영향을 미치는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "당뇨병 환자의 사망률과 신체 활동 간의 관계는 어떻게 설명할 수 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "신체 활동을 통한 질병 예방 및 관리의 경제적, 사회적 영향은 무엇인가?"}]}
{"headline": "Buffett Rule Tax Bill Would Raise $47 Billion Over 10 Years", "article": "Implementing a “Buffett rule” to require a minimum 30 percent tax rate for the highest U.S. earners would raise $47 billion over the next decade, according to a government projection. The estimate for the proposal backed by President Barack Obama comes from the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s scorekeepers. Lawmakers updated the projection late today to reflect different assumptions about how taxpayers would adjust their capital gains realizations from an earlier $31 billion version. “The president’s so-called Buffett rule is a dog that just won’t hunt,” Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah , the top Republican on the Finance Committee, said in a statement, adding that the proposal would have little effect on reducing the federal budget deficit. “It was designed for no other reason than politics. There is no economic rationale for it.” The $47 billion would have covered about half the cost of the 10-month extension of a payroll tax cut that Congress enacted last month. In a broader context, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obama’s 2013 budget plan would expand the deficit by $6.4 trillion over the next decade. The bill would reduce that by 0.7 percent. At the request of the Republican staff on the Finance Committee, the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed a bill written by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat. Minimum Rate The proposal would require a minimum rate for taxpayers with adjusted gross income exceeding $1 million. The bill would phase in the tax so that it would fully affect taxpayers with incomes exceeding $2 million, and it would allow charitable contributions to be deducted. “No matter how you slice it, that’s real money that could help bring down our deficit,” Whitehouse said in a statement today. “Most important: It’s simply the right thing to do.” Obama has said he sees the Buffett rule as a guideline for a tax-code overhaul. His budget didn’t include a specific proposal like Whitehouse’s. The so-called rule is named for billionaire Warren Buffett , who says tax rates on investment income should be raised. Expiring Rates Under current law, wages and other ordinary income are taxed at a top rate of 35 percent and capital gains and dividends are taxed at a top rate of 15 percent. The Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the bill under a scenario in which expiring income-tax cuts would be allowed to lapse. Under that scenario, wages and dividends would be taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent, capital gains would be taxed at a top rate of 20 percent and a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income would be in effect. Continuing current tax policy beyond this year, as many Republicans want, would prevent those rates from going up and keep the effective tax rates of more high-income taxpayers under the 30 percent mark. Under that scenario, which isn’t part of today’s estimate, the bill would raise more money for the government. The bill is S. 2059.

{"headline": "Australian Consumer Confidence Stagnates After RBA Rate Cut", "article": "Australian consumer confidence stagnated near the lowest level this year as concern about the global economy countered the central bank’s deepest interest- rate cut in three years, a private survey showed. The sentiment index for May rose 0.8 percent to 95.3, a Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) and Melbourne Institute survey taken May 7-11 of 1,200 consumers showed today in Sydney. From a year earlier, confidence was down 8.3 percent. “This is a disappointing result,” Bill Evans , Westpac’s chief economist, said in a statement, noting the polling followed the rate reduction and a May 10 report showing the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent for the first time in a year. “Increasingly disturbing news around Europe and specifically Greece is likely to have unnerved households.” The report reflects mortgage rates falling by an average 37 basis points after the Reserve Bank of Australia this month slashed the overnight cash rate target by half a percentage point to a two-year low of 3.75 percent, Westpac said. Almost 90 percent of Australian mortgages have variable rates. In minutes of its May 1 meeting released yesterday, the RBA explained that it lowered the benchmark by 50 basis points instead of the more widely forecast 25 points to ensure consumers borrowed at an “appropriate” level. Fiscal Tightening While monetary policy is loosened, fiscal policy is tightening. Prime Minister Julia Gillard ’s government unveiled a budget on May 8 that aims to return to surplus next year and scrapped a planned cut in company taxes to fund payouts for low- and middle-income earners. The plan’s “results were disappointing, with only 9.9 percent of respondents indicating that the budget would ‘improve’ family finances, while 36 percent indicated the budget would ‘worsen’ family finances,” Evans said. The budget includes a payment to families of as much as A$820 ($815) for each child in high school, while households with two children will receive an extra A$600 a year starting July 2013 using revenue from the mining tax. The government has also introduced an insurance plan for the disabled and boosted its national dentistry health-care coffers by A$513 million to reduce waiting lists at dentists. Rate-Cut Room Gillard said in an interview after the budget that a return to surplus gives the central bank “maximum room” to adjust rates if needed and ease pressure on manufacturers that have been hobbled by currency gains. Traders are pricing in an 89 percent chance of a quarter-point cut at the RBA’s June 5 meeting, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show. “We expect household will continue to be cautious and backs our call that RBA will follow up with a 25 basis-point cut in June,” said Celeste Tay, a Singapore-based economist at 4cast Ltd. Even after the RBA’s latest rate reduction, Australia has the highest benchmark borrowing cost among major developed economies. Policy rates are near zero in the U.S. and Japan , 1 percent in the euro area and Canada , and a record-low 2.5 percent in neighboring New Zealand. In his statement, Evans said “there is ample scope for further rate cuts.” He said that while the RBA may wait until July before easing again, “developments overseas along with today’s evidence that the recent cut has had little impact on confidence could easily see the bank bring the decision forward to the next board meeting.” Currency’s Fall The local currency, which soared to a post-1983 floating record of $1.1081 in July, has declined about 10 percent since then and this week fell below parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time this year. Earlier today the so-called Aussie traded as low as 99.30 U.S. cents and it was at 99.36 cents at 11:03 a.m. in Sydney. Australia’s unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent in March, the lowest level since April 2011, a government report showed last week. The economy is being powered by demand for energy and minerals located in the nation’s north and west from emerging countries including India and China , driving a more than 30 percent rise in the local currency in the past three years. That’s put pressure on non-resource industries such as manufacturing and tourism in the most-populous states of New South Wales and Victoria.

{"headline": "Lukoil Takes $1 Billion Impairment on Conoco Oilfield Venture", "article": "OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, recorded a $955 million impairment charge after a venture with ConocoPhillips (COP) found less oil than expected. Lukoil recorded the charge in the fourth quarter at its OOO Narianmarneftegaz venture with ConocoPhillips, it said in a statement. Lower production at the northern Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu deposit due to “unanticipated geological reasons” resulted in estimated field reserves falling to 142 million barrels at the end of 2011 from 505 million barrels in 2008. “It’s a paper loss reflecting the problems with the asset, which were already in the market,” Artem Konchin, an oil and gas analyst at UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said by phone from Moscow. Net income of $1.35 billion compared with profit of $2.19 billion in the same period a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said in a filing today. That missed the average estimate of $2.69 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts. Full-year net income at Lukoil reached a record $10.4 billion. Russian oil producers have posted record earnings for 2011 after unrest in the Middle East pushed average prices for the country’s Urals export blend to more than $100 a barrel. Lukoil has moved to expand internationally in West Africa, Iraq, Venezuela and Vietnam, after taxes and laws limited its access to Russian resources. This may mean additional expenses as international prospects lack the benefit of geological data inherited from the Soviet era. The company’s expenses for wells that failed to find commercial oil almost doubled to $417 million last year, Lukoil said in the statement. Dry wells, as they are called, cost $181 million in Ghana, $149 million in the Ivory Coast and $27 million in Vietnam, Lukoil said. Revenue rose to $133.7 billion in 2011 from $105 billion in 2010, Lukoil said.

{"headline": "Icahn Seen as Nothing Compared With Dell Turnaround", "article": "When Michael Dell took his company public in 1988, the personal-computer maker’s biggest competitors were International Business Machines Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000. The headstrong founder was later quoted joking that his daughter’s first words were to “kill IBM” and his other rivals. A quarter century later, as Dell takes his Round Rock, Texas-based company private in a $24.9 billion transaction following shareholder approval yesterday, the landscape has shifted. The PC business is dwindling, leaving Dell Inc. (DELL) out of step with a technology world moving to smartphones and tablets dominated by companies including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. This presents Michael Dell and his team a challenging balancing act even outside the pressure of quarterly earnings reports. As the company seeks to become less reliant on selling PCs, transforming into a bigger provider of hardware, software and services for corporations, it faces competitors including Cisco Systems Inc., EMC Corp. and Oracle Corp. Results in the quarters since the go-private deal was announced show that Dell’s trials are poised to deepen. “I have a lot of respect for Michael Dell but I don’t think he has greater insights than anybody else with what to do with Dell,” said Michael Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. “He’s been scratching his head for 10 years.” Hard Road Once the go-private deal closes, the scratching ends and the hard work begins. Dell plans to continue investing in PCs and tablets, especially in emerging countries, and will price products to gain market share at the sacrifice of profits. The CEO will also focus on using Dell’s server business to sell higher-margin products to corporate customers. At the same time, Dell is looking to acquire companies in the $500 million to $1 billion range, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The shareholder vote, announced at Dell headquarters, ended seven months of jockeying between Michael Dell and financial partner Silver Lake Management LLC and investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn. The takeover of the third-largest PC maker is the biggest LBO since Blackstone Group LP took Hilton Worldwide Inc. private in 2007. Michael Dell based his pitch for going private on the idea that he could boost spending on acquisitions, sales staff and research and development, while expanding the company’s reach in emerging countries, according to regulatory filings. Undertaking those investments as a public entity would “weaken earnings and cause greater volatility” in the stock price , Dell told the board. ‘Our Roots’ “In taking Dell private we plan to go back to our roots,” Michael Dell said on a conference call. Once the world’s No. 1 PC maker, Dell has become a patchwork of desktops and notebooks, less-than-popular tablets, plus enterprise software and data-center gear. Sales this year are expected to fall to about $57.2 billion, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, from $62.1 billion two years ago. Operating profit may drop 20 percent to $2.4 billion. Leading the decline are PCs, which still account for two-thirds of Dell revenue when including related products like monitors and printers. Operating income in that group dropped 71 percent in the fiscal second quarter that ended Aug. 2. From April to June, global PC shipments decreased 10.9 percent to 76 million, according to market researcher Gartner Inc., the fifth straight period of decline. Post Buyout Dell’s PC strategy post-buyout represents a bet it can remain a force in that market even as sales dwindle. Its plans include pushing PCs in China and other emerging markets and, to pare costs and compete better with Apple, simplifying its longstanding build-to-order model, offering customers fewer choices. Only about 20 percent of Dell’s PC sales are to consumers while business and government buy the rest, according to Jayson Noland , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco. It also is emphasizing revenue and cash flow over profits, the company has said in filings, an option easier to take as a private company. Dell used to walk away from PC sales it didn’t deem profitable enough, such as the craze for $300 mini-laptops that seized the consumer market a few years ago, said Richard Shim, an analyst at NPD DisplaySearch. Now, Dell is more willing to shave prices. Margins First “We’ve seen a strategic change at the company,” said Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. “In the past, they were willing to cede share in PCs to preserve margins and satisfy public markets by running it for profitability.” For its corporate business, Dell is looking to exploit its strong market share in server computers -- now a close second to Hewlett-Packard Co. in unit shipments, according to Gartner -- as a means to selling more higher-margin software, storage and networking gear. In June, Marius Haas, president of Dell’s enterprise solutions division, and his old boss at Hewlett-Packard, current Oracle co-president Mark Hurd, announced a deal that lets Dell customers buy servers pre-configured to run Oracle’s database and other software more reliably. “We’re not just throwing out empty calories to pick up unit share,” Haas said recently. Haas will be responsible for acquisitions of companies that make storage and networking gear, which he would then package for businesses with Dell servers. Track Record Dell’s track record on enterprise-related acquisitions hasn’t been stellar. It has spent $13 billion since 2009 to buy more than 20 companies including computer terminal maker Wyse Technology Inc. and networking company Force10 Networks Inc. Returns on those deals, meant to bolster sales of software, storage and servers to corporations, haven’t hit the company’s 15 percent target, and many have required more investment to grow, according to a July presentation by the special committee of Dell’s board overseeing the buyout. Sales generated from these companies also aren’t offsetting the drop in PC shipments, said Noland. “Tech turnarounds are tough,” he said. “The argument is they can transform more quickly if they’re private. So far the pace at which they’ve executed a turnaround has been slower than the rate of decline in the PC market.” ‘Broad Reset’ Dell is “digesting” acquisitions it’s made, said Dell Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden yesterday. “We’ve done obviously a pretty broad reset on the strategy over the last five years.” Turning private may complicate Dell’s acquisition plans as it doesn’t have access to public equity capital markets. Its debt will rise to less than $20 billion after the buyout from around $7 billion, according to Gladden. Dell will spend less than $1.2 billion a year to service the debt from the buyout, he said, describing the added borrowing as “incremental.” Going private gives the company more leeway on spending and acquisitions, he said. “We can be a bit more aggressive,” he said. “You can’t just kind of go crazy and spend however you want. You still have to be disciplined.” Michael Dell, who built his company from a dorm-room PC assembler, is also reckoning with a tough roster of competitors ranging from Apple and Lenovo Group Ltd. in personal computing to Cisco, IBM, Oracle, EMC and a healthier Hewlett-Packard in enterprise. Most of them are buying to get bigger too. “There are a lot of CEOs who have tried to take companies private to get away from the market and rationalize the company and figure out what to do next,” said MIT’s Cusumano. “It’s an uphill battle.” To contact the reporter on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at  aricadela@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at  ptam13@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "PC 시장의 감소세가 지속된다면, 델이 PC 시장에서 철수하는 것이 더 나은 선택일까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "델이 기업용 솔루션 사업을 강화하기 위해 어떤 전략을 취하고 있으며, 이 전략이 성공하기 위해서는 어떤 조건이 필요할까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "델이 사모펀드로 전환한 후, 기업가치와 리스크 프로파일에 어떤 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상되며, 이를 고려한 투자 전략은 어떻게 수립해야 할까요?"}]}
{"headline": "Ethiopia, China Communications in $1.5 Billion Rail Deal", "article": "Ethiopia signed a $1.5 billion agreement with state-run China Communications Construction Co. to build a railway to carry potash from mines being developed in the nation’s northeast. The 360-kilometer (224-mile) line will transport passengers and freight along a route to neighboring Djibouti’s Tadjourah port, which is being built. It should be completed by July 2015, Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website yesterday. CCCC (1800) , a Chinese government-owned transportation infrastructure company, will be “mobilizing substantial resources to guarantee completion of the project,” the ministry said, citing the company’s vice president, Zhou Yongheng. Ethiopia, sub-Saharan Africa’s second-most populous nation, is in the middle of a five-year plan to modernize and upgrade its infrastructure and industries.

{"headline": "MEMC Slides on Forecast for First-Quarter Solar Sales", "article": "MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, fell the most in nine months after forecasting a decline in solar project development this quarter. MEMC, which also announced plans today to change its name to SunEdison Inc. and invest in more solar projects that use its material, dropped 13 percent to $4.70 at the close in New York, the biggest decline since May 17. The company sees sales of 10 megawatts to 38 megawatts of solar projects in the first quarter, down from 52 megawatts in the prior quarter. Total sales for 2013 will be 420 megawatts to 490 megawatts, a 28 percent increase from the 383 megawatts sold last year, the St. Peters, Missouri-based company said in a statement today. “The decision to hold projects on the balance sheet instead of selling them will be viewed negatively by some,” Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in New York , said in an e-mail. “It soaks up the use of cash with a long-term financial return as opposed to a quick flip of a project sale.” MEMC makes polysilicon wafers that can be used in semiconductors and solar cells. The company bought SunEdison LLC, a solar project developer, in 2009. The proportion of revenues that came from solar projects and materials climbed to 68 percent last year, from 59 percent in 2010, the company said. Global Market There may be $1 trillion in global solar project investment through 2020, Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Chatila said at the company’s investor meeting today. MEMC is targeting quarterly project sales of 150 megawatts to 200 megawatts in what he called “a hyper growth situation.” The company said in a separate release today it plans to form SunEdison Capital, a unit to finance and invest in the solar power plants it’s developing. Carlos Domenech, an MEMC executive vice president, will be president of the new division, which will fund both internal and external solar projects and may acquire new solar developments. On the semiconductor side, MEMC forecast a slower first half with an “industry recovery” in the second half boosting sales. Revenue for the unit will be $940 million to $990 million for 2013. The company reported $918 million in semiconductor sales last year. Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is the biggest U.S. polysilicon producer.

{"headline": "Jansa Sees Slovenia ‘on Safe Side’ on Bailout by Year End", "article": "Slovenia won’t need an international rescue package if stabilization measures are adopted by the end of the year, Prime Minister Janez Jansa said. The government is pushing ahead with measures to stabilize the ailing banking industry, to consolidate public finances as well as overhaul the pension system and the labor market, Jansa told reporters today in Bratislava, Slovakia. “With all these efforts, passing necessary decisions by year’s end, I think Slovenia is on the safe side and we will come out of waters when there are question marks about a possible bailout,” Jansa said. “This will also improve the country’s situation on financial markets.” Rising bad loans at lenders in Slovenia such as Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and Nova Kreditna Banka (KBMR) Maribor d.d. and the faltering economy are at the center of investors’ concern that the Adriatic nation may become the sixth euro-region member to ask for international aid. If all government efforts are implemented, Slovenia will not need a rescue program, central bank Governor Marko Kranjec said at Brdo, Slovenia, yesterday, where the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held its meeting. ‘Significant Action’ Slovenia has taken “significant action” with efforts “on all fronts - fiscal consolidation, efforts on structural reforms and the banking system,” ECB President Mario Draghi said in an interview with public broadcaster TV Slovenija late yesterday. Lawmakers in the capital Ljubljana on Oct. 3 approved legislation to stabilize the country’s banking industry. They voted to create a special agency that will assume lenders’ bad loans and swap them for government-guaranteed bonds worth as much as 4 billion euros ($5.22 billion) that could be eligible as collateral with the ECB, according to Finance Minister Janez Sustersic. When asked whether the ECB will accept Slovenian state bonds as collateral, Jansa said the government has had a “good discussion” with the ECB about a plan to help the banking industry, adding that the Frankfurt-based bank gave its support to government’s measures.

{"headline": "Egyptians Vote in Contest Between Islamist, Mubarak Aide", "article": "Egyptians cast ballots for their first president since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year, in a runoff election widely portrayed as a choice between reviving the old regime and endorsing a new Islamist one. The contest between Ahmed Shafik, who briefly served as Mubarak’s last premier, and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi, comes two days after the country’s highest court ordered the dissolution of parliament, where Islamists have a majority. That raised concerns among activists that the ruling military may engineer a return of the ousted regime. Mursi “is the better of two bad options,” Gamal Abdel- Azim, a 49-year-old physician, said as he queued at a polling station in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City. “I was against Hosni Mubarak’s regime, so it doesn’t make sense for me to choose the return of the old regime in an even stronger way.” While the first round of voting last month had been billed as the country’s first free and fair presidential election, the ruling generals and election officials have warned of stiff penalties for anyone who tries to rig or disrupt the vote. Several local and international groups, including the Carter Center , are observing the ballot. Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said authorities had received information some people planned to disguise themselves as police or military personnel to “carry out hostile acts,” the official Middle East News Agency reported today. Vanishing Ink Authorities arrested several people who were allegedly handing out pens to voters in Alexandria that contained vanishing ink, state television reported. MENA reported that only pens made available by the election commission can be used. Many Egyptians have voiced unease about the two candidates, who were among the most divisive politicians to stand in the first round. Shafik and Mursi only garnered a combined total of about 50 percent of the vote last month. Ahead of this round, calls for a boycott mounted, leading officials and candidates to urge Egyptians to vote. Polling stations will stay open an extra hour, until 9 p.m., MENA reported. The Brotherhood seized on the June 14 court rulings, which also included throwing out a law that would have driven Shafik from the race, as evidence of efforts to restore Mubarak’s regime. Both the group and youth activists described the decision, along with the military’s newly-granted powers to arrest civilians, as a “coup.” ‘Period of Silence’ The two-day vote “comes amid methodical attempts to thwart the Egyptian revolution,” Mursi’s campaign said in an e-mailed statement today, even though yesterday marked the start of the so-called “period of silence” that bans campaigning. Activists had called for a mass rally yesterday to protest the rulings. The call drew only hundreds of people to Cairo’s Tahrir Square , instead of the tens of thousands who rallied during the uprising against Mubarak last year. “We’ve had enough of protests and demonstrations and million-man marches,” Farah Mohsen, a 24-year-old mother of three, said in an interview in Dar el-Salam, a district in Cairo. “I don’t want the old regime, but I also don’t want this mess.” Mohsen, whose husband has struggled to find work for more than a year after being fired as a driver from a tour company, said she was voting for Shafik. Brotherhood Support Support for the Brotherhood, whose political arm won almost half the seats in Parliament’s lower house, has waned amid disputes between the party and the interim government, judiciary and military. The state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported today that the Islamist-led legislature had passed 11 laws since winning power about six months ago. “We’ve had enough of the Brotherhood’s games,” Baher el- Nahhas, a 37-year-old civil servant, said in an interview in Cairo, as he waited to cast his vote for Shafik. “This country needs leadership and progress, and all they’ve done is slow us down after the uprising.” About 50 million Egyptians are eligible to vote, with about half this number turning out in the first round that narrowed the candidate field down from 13 to the current two. The court rulings have raised concerns that political turmoil will persist since the president will likely take office without a constitution that defines his powers. Fitch Ratings yesterday cut Egypt ’s foreign-currency debt by one step to B+, four levels below investment grade, citing “increased uncertainties surrounding the political transition” after the verdict. Foreign reserves dropped by more than half since the beginning of last year and a $3.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund loan is yet to be approved. Bond Losses Egypt’s bonds extended losses yesterday and credit risk jumped the most in almost a month after the June 14 rulings. Five-year credit default swaps rose 22 basis points to 648, according to CMA, which is owned by GME Group Inc. and compiles data from the privately negotiated market. Dina Darwish, a 23-year-old graphic designer, said she planned to invalidate her vote by marking both names on her ballot. “Neither candidate is good,” Darwish, who supported socialist candidate Hamdeen Sabahi in the first round, said in an interview in Cairo. “The Muslim Brotherhood is not the solution, and voting for Shafik would be like going back to the very beginning.” Election Pledges Mursi cast himself as the “candidate of the revolution,” signaling he may appoint a Christian vice president, while trying to allay concerns that he would curtail individual freedoms. Shafik has run on pledges to restore law and order and keep Egypt secular. He sought to appeal to youth activists by promising that he would not censor the Internet. The military has repeatedly said it is not backing any of the candidates, though the developments over the past few days raised suspicions among many voters. “Is this a coincidence?” said Mohamed el-Haj, a 47-year- old shop clerk and Mursi supporter, referring to the timing of the court verdict and the handing of new powers to the military to arrest civilians. “The military has been staging a play all along and the final act is this election that will bring Shafik to power.” -- With assistance from Ahmed A.

{"headline": "Microsoft Spurs Technology Rally as Amazon Shares Gain 4.5%", "article": "Computer and Internet stocks led gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) surged the most since September and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) climbed to the highest level in six weeks. Microsoft rose 3.7 percent to $25.20 at 4 p.m. in New York , and Amazon advanced 4.5 percent to $201.25. Technology stocks in the S&P 500 increased 1.4 percent, the most among 10 groups in the index. Spending on computers by companies and governments in the U.S. will grow 5.6 percent in 2011, about double the estimated increase for gross domestic product, according to International Data Corp. Since the S&P 500 bottomed on March 16, technology shares have posted the third-worst returns in the S&P 500 among the 10 industries. “There probably was a bit more pessimism that was really merited, and some of that pessimism is coming out,” said Michael Yoshikami , chief investment strategist at YCMNet Advisors, which manages $1 billion in Walnut Creek, California. Investors “are putting back on some risk.” Technology is the biggest industry in the benchmark measure of U.S. equities, making up 18 percent of its value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker, gained a day before Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is scheduled to discuss Microsoft Office 365, which is a subscription for cloud, or Internet-based, versions of many of Microsoft’s Office programs. ‘Very Good’ “This idea of companies broadly adopting cloud-based technology is very good for the group in general, and specifically software,” said Brad Reback, an Oppenheimer & Co. analyst in Atlanta. “There’s a real opportunity to continue to drive strong secular growth for many of the software names.” Amazon rose after Morgan Stanley added the world’s largest online retailer to its “Best Ideas” list. Revenue and margins are likely to beat investors’ estimates in the final three months of 2011, the busiest period of the year for the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a note today. Amazon is growing at more than twice the rate of the broader e-commerce industry and will continue gaining market share over the next five to 20 years, Devitt said. The company is currently undervalued given its sales momentum and the potential for margin expansion, he said. Devitt predicted that Amazon’s stock will rise to $245 a share. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to 1,280.10 today after losing 2.1 percent in the past three days.

{"headline": "Aberdeen’s Daly Says China May Hike Reserve Ratio on Inflation", "article": "Kevin Daly , a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc. in London , comments on China ’s monetary policy outlook and Indonesia’s rating outlook. Daly, who helps manage $6.5 billion in emerging-market funds, spoke today at a briefing in Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China yesterday lifted the one-year deposit and lending rates by a quarter of a percentage point each to 3.5 percent and 6.56 percent respectively. On China: “China will continue to tighten policy if inflation remains on the high side. If it remains at a 6 and 6.5 percent range for July, we’re likely to see further tightening. You are probably back to another 50 basis points hike in the required reserve ratio. Policy rates probably not because obviously they want to drain more liquidity from the financial sector. It’s going to be very data-dependent after August.” You will see inflation peaking in the next several months probably at around 6.5 percent. We’re likely to see a pause in tightening measures and that will start to provide some support to the market. We have less concern about growth. In some way, adjustment is underway in China. We see growth as probably coming out at around 8.5 percent this year.’’ On Indonesia : “Indonesia has one of the lowest fiscal deficit positions among the emerging countries. Its fiscal balance remains very strong and there’s a big increase in foreign direct investment as well. It’s a resource-rich country, which is benefiting from not just the mix of commodities but also the coal shortage in China and India. What’s probably holding back the upgrade are the subsidies, which stand at about 3 percent of its GDP. The expectation is you are likely to see some move on subsidies over the next year. That would be a signal for rating agencies that this is a positive sign.” To contact the reporter on this story: Fion Li in Hong Kong at  fli59@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sandy Hendry at  shendry@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "중국의 통화정책 긴축이 계속될 경우, 중국 경제 성장률에 어떤 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상되나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "인도네시아의 재정적자 수준이 낮은 것이 국가 신용등급에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "중국의 통화정책 긴축과 인도네시아의 재정적자 수준이 신흥시장 펀드 투자 전략에 어떤 영향을 줄 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "Prudential Veteran Accounts `Dishonest,' American Legion Says", "article": "Prudential Financial Inc. ’s practice of collecting interest on unpaid veterans’ life-insurance benefits is “unlawful and dishonest,” the American Legion told a judge yesterday. The American Legion, the largest U.S. veterans’ service organization with 2.5 million members in almost 14,000 posts worldwide, asked permission to file a legal brief supporting a pending case in Springfield, Massachusetts, against Prudential Insurance Co. of America, a unit of Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial. The pending lawsuit by the families of deceased veterans accuses the insurer of failing to pay beneficiaries in a lump sum as required by U.S. law and the language of the policies. Instead, the lawsuit says that Prudential strongly encourages beneficiaries to keep the money in accounts with the company, which pays them a small amount of interest. The “practice is unlawful and dishonest,” the American Legion said in its court filing. “It is especially objectionable because sophisticated money managers are making an unwarranted and unlawful profit from the deaths of those who have given the most to preserve our nation’s way of life.” Bob DeFillippo , a spokesman for Prudential Financial, declined to comment on the filing. He has previously said that the company informs beneficiaries of their payment options and that they may immediately withdraw the money from their Prudential Alliance Accounts and invest it wherever they choose. ‘Fallen Heroes’ Prudential held $662 million of survivors’ money in its corporate general account as of June 30, according to information provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Prudential’s general account earned 4.2 percent in 2009, mostly from bond investments, according to regulatory filings. The company has paid survivors holding Alliance Accounts 0.5 percent in 2010. More than 100 insurance carriers earn investment income on $28 billion owed to life insurance beneficiaries, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported in July. Insurers keep the money in their general account, paying only when the beneficiaries write drafts, or “checks” on the account, Bloomberg reported. The American Legion brief filed yesterday cites the Bloomberg stories. The American Legion, which Congress chartered in 1919 to represent the interests of veterans, seeks permission in its submission yesterday to join the lawsuit and to file a brief opposing the so-called retained asset accounts used by Prudential. The brief was included as part of the filing. Prudential’s “disingenuous practices take advantage of the grieving families of America’s fallen heroes,” the American Legion says. “This procedure is morally objectionable and unlawful. It should be stopped.” Transfer Request Prudential has asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying the insurer’s delivery of a “checkbook” to beneficiaries complies with its legal obligation. Lawyers for beneficiaries who brought the case yesterday filed a separate brief opposing Prudential’s request. The suit seeks class-action, or group, status on behalf of other beneficiaries. Prudential is also seeking to transfer this and a similar case in California to the federal court in New Jersey, where the insurer previously won a favorable ruling in another lawsuit over retained asset accounts. The case is Lucey v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 10-30163, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Springfield).

{"headline": "Petrominerales Posts Record Gain on New Well Flow: Bogota Mover", "article": "Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG) rallied the most on record after the Canadian driller said output jumped by at least 8.8 percent from first-quarter levels as a new well in Colombia added to production. Petrominerales rose 12 percent to 12,500 pesos at 12:29 p.m. in Bogota after early increasing as much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday gain since the shares started trading in August 2011. The stock was the biggest winner today on the Colombian Colcap index , which rose 0.9 percent. The Curito-1 exploration well in central Colombia produced an average 5,973 barrels of oil per day initially with an electric pump, the company said in a statement yesterday. Under natural conditions without the pump, the well has been flowing at a stabilized rate of more than 2,700 barrels a day. The company said its total output is now more than 24,000 barrels a day, up from an average of 22,063 barrels a day in the three months through March. Rising output “should modestly ease” concern about funding challenges, Jared Dziuba, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research report today. Petrominerales, which is selling assets after its cash balance tumbled by 89 percent over the past year, has received interest from prospective buyers in stakes in Colombian oil pipelines, Chief Executive Officer Corey Ruttan said in a telephone interview yesterday. Holders of convertible bonds are expected to exercise an option to demand repayment of about $200 million in August, he said. Petrominerales, which reported a 35 percent drop in first-quarter output from a year earlier, is seeking to “maintain and modestly grow production this year,” Ruttan said.

{"headline": "Obamas Report Income of $608,611 as Tax Rate Declines", "article": "President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama earned $608,611 in adjusted gross income in 2012, down 23 percent from 2011 as royalties from the president’s books kept declining, tax returns showed. Obama and his wife paid $112,214 in federal income taxes, according to the returns released yesterday, for an 18.4 percent rate. That’s less than the 20.5 percent rate they paid the year before. While still making more than 10 times the U.S. median income, they made less money in 2012 than in any year since 2004, when Obama -- then a state legislator -- was running for the U.S. Senate in Illinois and started attracting national attention. By taking widely used deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Obamas were able to get themselves out of the top marginal tax bracket, which was 35 percent last year. “Obama’s returns are very sanitized,” said Steven Bankler, a certified public accountant in San Antonio, Texas , who has analyzed previous presidential tax returns. That’s because the president is a “very, very conservative” investor, mainly putting his money in U.S. government bonds. In 2012, the Obamas made $150,034 in charitable contributions and paid $45,046 in mortgage interest on their home in Chicago. Fisher House Their largest charitable contribution -- $103,871 -- went to the Fisher House Foundation, which assists military families. They also donated money to the American Red Cross, the National AIDS Fund, the University of Hawaii Foundation and Washington’s Sidwell Friends School, which their daughters attend. In 2012 returns released for Vice President Joseph Biden and his wife, Jill, showed they had $385,072 in adjusted gross income and paid $87,851 in federal taxes for a 22.8 percent rate. The Bidens donated $7,190 to charity. The Obamas reported paying $29,450 in Illinois income taxes. Households making between $500,000 and $1 million paid an average federal income tax rate of 20.6 percent in 2012, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That’s not a perfect comparison to the Obamas’ 18.4 percent rate, in part because some of their federal taxes are payroll taxes on income from book sales. Obama’s salary as president is $400,000. Business Income The president’s book earnings have declined during his time in office. This year, the Obamas reported business income of $258,772, down from $441,369 in 2011 and $1.4 million in 2010. The Obamas’ adjusted gross income in 2012 was 11 percent of what they made in 2009, his first year in office and the peak of his income from two books, “Dreams from My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope.” In 2010 he published a book aimed at children, “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.” The tax increases on top earners that Obama signed into law in January take effect for tax year 2013 and some of them may make the president pay a higher rate when he files next year. So will the health-care law he signed in 2010, which included tax increases that took effect this year. Obama would also pay more in taxes if the budget he proposed this week is passed by Congress. He called for limiting the value of itemized deductions and other tax breaks of top earners to the value they would get if they were in the 28 percent tax bracket, which ends at $223,050 of taxable income for married couples. The Obamas’ taxable income was $335,026. ‘Pay More’ “Under the president’s own tax proposals, including limitations on the value of tax preferences for high-income households, he would pay more in taxes while ensuring we cut taxes for the middle class and those trying to get in it,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on the White House website. Obama proposals that could increase his taxes include a new limit on adding money to tax-advantaged retirement accounts once they reach $3.4 million, Bankler said. Obama contributed $50,000 of his book earnings to a type of retirement plan for self- employed workers, according to his return. “That’s the irony,” Bankler said. The Obamas would pay about $3,300 more in taxes under the laws that took effect in January, based on figures from their 2012 return, according to an analysis by Tony Nitti, a tax partner at WithumSmith & Brown in Aspen, Colorado. More of their earnings would be subject to tax because their adjusted gross income exceeds $300,000. Congress reinstated limits on the value of deductions and personal exemptions starting at that threshold for 2013. Still, the loss of those breaks wouldn’t change the Obamas’ tax liability much because they also are subject to the alternative minimum tax, Nitti said. Payroll Taxes The added tax bite mainly would come from higher payroll taxes and two new levies starting this year as a result of the 2010 health-care law, he said. Congress let a two-percentage- point cut in the payroll tax expire at the end of last year for all taxpayers. The Obamas also are subject to a new 0.9 percent surtax on wages and 3.8 percent added tax on investment income for individuals making more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. The Obamas would owe even more in the analysis if the president’s original proposal had passed, Nitti said. Obama wanted to raise income-tax rates for individuals making more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Instead Congress raised the top rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for taxable income above $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples. ‘Spared’ Taxpayers “There were a lot of taxpayers that were spared at the last minute,” Nitti said. “You need to look no further than the president of the United States.” The Obamas reported $11,462 in taxable interest and $2 in dividends while taking a $3,000 capital loss against their ordinary income. According to financial disclosure forms released last year, at the end of 2011, their net worth was between $2.6 million and $8.3 million. Between $1.6 million and $6.25 million of that amount was invested in U.S. Treasury notes and bills. The disclosure forms list amounts in ranges rather than specific amounts.

He’s providing advice in a “personal capacity” and won’t be paid for the role, it said. Riots that began in north London on Aug. 6 quickly spread across the capital and to cities including Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said today he’s committed to reducing police spending and that the challenges facing Britain are not simply about budgets but “deep-seated social problems.” Bratton was a candidate to take charge of London’s Metropolitan Police, known as the Met, in 2004, two years into his stint as commissioner of the LA force, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time. Bob Kiley, an American who was in charge of the London subway, had urged Bratton to apply for the post after working with him in New York City , the paper reported. Eviction Notice London police have arrested 1,222 people following the past week’s disorder, and 704 people have been charged, according to the Met website. In Manchester, northwest England , more than 200 people have been arrested, Greater Manchester Police said today. A man in his twenties has been charged with robbing a Malaysian student after pretending to assist him after an attack in Barking, London, the Met said today. Video pictures showed men approaching the victim under the guise of providing help, only to rifle through his bag and steal a games console. The student was released from hospital with a broken jaw. Councils are also cracking down on suspected looters, with a mother served an eviction notice from her 225,000-pound ($366,000) flat in Battersea after her son was charged with violent disorder and attempting to steal goods from a Currys electrical store, according to the Daily Mail newspaper. Under housing rules, tenants can be thrown out if anyone is involved in crime, the newspaper said. Fatalities The unrest began in the London suburb of Tottenham after a local man, Mark Duggan, was shot and killed by police who stopped his car intending to make an arrest. The violence has seen gasoline bombs thrown and cars, homes and shops torched. Three men died when they were hit by a car while protecting property in Birmingham, another lost his life after being shot in Croydon, south London, and Richard Mannington Bowes, 68 was killed in riots in Ealing in the west of the capital. Some British communities have been left behind by the rest of the nation and cut off from its “economic lifeblood,” Osborne said today. His remarks to the British Broadcasting Corp. come after Cameron, who cut short his holiday to deal with the disorder, rejected opposition demands for a review of policing cuts following Britain’s worst rioting since the 1980s. The government is reducing the number of officers by 30,000 across the country as it seeks to narrow the budget deficit.

{"headline": "Rubber Falls Most in a Week as Debt Woes Raises Growth Concern", "article": "Rubber tumbled the most in more than a week as a reduction in Greece ’s credit rating and a selloff in global equities boosted concern that the economic recovery may falter, curbing demand for the commodity used in tires. The October-delivery contract lost as much as 4 percent to 363 yen a kilogram ($4,429 a metric ton) before settling at 367.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The contract gained 1.8 percent last week, the second weekly advance. Asian stocks extended a global decline, with the regional benchmark index heading for a two-month low, as Fitch Ratings cut Greece’s credit rating three levels and the euro weakened, reducing the outlook for export earnings. The index of U.S. leading indicators slipped in April after nine months of increases, while manufacturing in the Philadelphia area grew in May at the slowest pace in seven months. “Concern about U.S. and European economies spurred sales of industrial commodities,” Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone. “Rubber was sold in tandem with oil and base metals.” Fitch Ratings cut Greece three levels to B+, four steps below investment grade, from BB+. Fitch said even a “soft” restructuring of debt being studied by European Union policy makers would be considered a default. Fitch said Greece could face a further reduction in its creditworthiness. “The biggest concern about Europe is the risk of contagion and of credit markets drying up globally,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “The memory of the global financial crisis is fresh in everyone’s mind, and everybody’s preference is that we don’t go there again.” China Demand “Supply is outpacing demand and declining inventories in China reflects that orders from there are still low,” said Chaiwat Muenmee, analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS Futures Co. Natural-rubber stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 215 tons to 13,946 tons last week, the bourse said on May 20. Inventories reached 11,851 tons earlier this month, the lowest level since 2003. Rubber also declined amid expectation that supply from Thailand, the world’s largest exporter, will increase as the low-production period is set to end this month, Saito said. Natural-rubber output will expand as farmers resume harvesting after the traditional low-production season, easing global supplies, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said in a monthly report in April. Production from its member countries, representing 92 percent of global supply, may climb 10.5 percent to 2.3 million tons in the three months through June, the report said. Output in the first quarter is estimated to have advanced 6.1 percent to 2.27 million tons, the group said. The physical price of Thai rubber declined 0.3 percent to 154.25 baht ($5.08) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand. In Shanghai, September-delivery rubber lost 2.1 percent to close at 30,830 yuan ($4,741) a ton.

{"headline": "Why ‘You Didn’t Build That’ Resonates", "article": "Jonathan Chait says the president’s \"you didn't build that\" speech revived racial resentments about redistributive fiscal policy, partly because the president was speaking in a “black dialect.” Maybe this was a problem with the speech, but the key problem was much simpler: The president was needlessly insulting. He wasn’t just calling on successful people to pay more in tax but was being dismissive of their accomplishments. I agree with David Frum that the most toxic part of the speech is Barack Obama talking about the sources of success: I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. Really? The president is always struck by people who take credit for their own successes? Obviously, every successful outcome in life -- and every failed one -- arises from a combination of internal and external factors. But the president’s tone when he said this, amused by the very idea of people taking credit for their achievements, was off-putting. Frum mostly talks about why this statement irks rich people, but I believe it resonates badly with people at all income levels. Lots of people -- most, I hope -- are proud of something they’ve achieved in their lives and feel like that achievement owes much to their own hard work and talents. You don’t have to make over $250,000 a year to be annoyed when the president mocks people for taking credit for their achievements. And it’s an especially jarring statement because of what it’s used to justify -- higher taxes, with the implication being that they are called for because people do not deserve their own pre-tax wealth. People are rightly unnerved by an argument that amounts to “we can tax you because you didn’t deserve this anyway.” Faced with such an argument, defending your own contribution to your success isn’t just a point of pride -- it’s an argument you must make to defend the principle that you are entitled to your own private property. The president’s speech calls to mind a second-season West Wing episode, in which speechwriter Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) explains to the staff of some liberal house members why he won’t insert a line in President Bartlet’s upcoming speech. They want the president to attack Republican tax cut proposals as financing “private jets and swimming pools” for the wealthy. As Seaborn argues: Henry, last fall, every time your boss got on the stump and said, \"It's time for the rich to pay their fair share,\" I hid under a couch and changed my name. I left Gage Whitney making $400,000 a year, which means I paid twenty-seven times the national average in income tax. I paid my fair share, and the fair share of twenty-six other people. And I'm happy to 'cause that's the only way it's gonna work, and it's in my best interest that everybody be able to go to schools and drive on roads, but I don't get twenty-seven votes on Election Day. The fire department doesn't come to my house twenty-seven times faster and the water doesn't come out of my faucet twenty-seven times hotter. The top one percent of wage earners in this country pay for twenty-two percent of this country. Let's not call them names while they're doing it, is all I'm saying. When Barack Obama has made an argument for progressive taxation that even Aaron Sorkin finds distasteful, he has erred. That’s not a problem that has anything to do with the president being black. Chait seems taken aback by how much his post offended conservative writers. But when Chait argues the “real reason” attacks on the president are working is racial resentment (and, for good measure, that racial resentment is “the entire key to the rise of the Republican Party ” since the 1960s), the implication is that complaints about the “you didn’t build that” speech are per se invalid. Chait didn’t directly accuse anybody of being a racist, but that doesn’t mean people shouldn’t be annoyed about his post. It’s true that racial undertones are everywhere in American discourse. But not everything that has a racial component is principally about race. Scott Brown ’s campaign mashed up “you didn’t build that” with Elizabeth Warren ’s similar remarks, which share the president’s derisive tone but of course lack any African-American speaking rhythms. The Brown hit is effective -- and it shows that the president’s speech would have been problematic from the mouth of a white politician, too.

{"headline": "Obama Critics Overstate Rules’ Effects, Sunstein Says", "article": "Critics of the regulations imposed during President Barack Obama ’s administration have overstated their effects on the U.S. economy , said Cass Sunstein, who left his post this year as the administration’s top regulator. “If you’ve got any kernel of a complaint, you turn it into a mountain” in an election year, said Sunstein, now a professor at Harvard Law School and a contributor to Bloomberg View. Sunstein, 57, spoke at the Bloomberg Link at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs until August. He said the Obama administration has proposed fewer regulations than those of his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush. Sunstein said he tried to bring an approach that relied on cost-benefit analysis, so that the public could see what it was getting from regulations. “The cost-benefit analysis I think is first and foremost a technical exercise, but it has a big democratic payoff, democratic with a small d,” he said. Sunstein also said he appreciated input from members of Congress, who usually had constructive information about the effect of regulations. Tom Miller , a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , singled out Sunstein for criticism in responding to his remarks. “Barack Obama’s regulations have choked business growth and nobody is more out of touch with how to spur small business than legal professor Cass Sunstein,” Miller said in an e-mail.

The New York Fed is collecting bids on more than $1.4 billion of securities and expects offers on April 6 or sooner, according to the people, who declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the sales process.

{"headline": "Vietnam Economic Growth Slows to 5.43% After Rate Increases", "article": "Vietnam’s growth slowed in the first quarter after the central bank raised key interest rates to among the highest levels in Southeast Asia to tame inflation. Gross domestic product climbed 5.43 percent in the three months through March from a year earlier, according to a preliminary estimate released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi today, compared with 7.34 percent in the fourth quarter. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has lowered the target for credit growth and ordered a tighter monetary policy as he struggles to prevent inflation climbing from a 25-month high. Price gains, a widening trade deficit, currency weakness and the near-bankruptcy of the nation’s largest shipbuilder have contributed to a slide in the stock market this year. “The slowdown is happening quite sharply, and while inflation is accelerating,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based economist at Credit Agricole CIB. “Good news for Vietnam will only come with weaker consumer price inflation.” The benchmark VN Index on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange has declined about 5.7 percent this year, compared with a 3.7 percent fall in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The VN Index declined 0.5 percent to 457.09 at 10:25 a.m. local time today. The yield on the benchmark five-year bond rose five basis points to 11.92 percent yesterday, the biggest jump since March 7, according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Quickening Inflation Consumer prices increased 13.89 percent in March from a year earlier, stoked by costlier fuel and electricity and higher import costs caused by devaluations of the dong. Kowalczyk expects inflation to peak at 14.5 percent in the second quarter. The State Bank of Vietnam raised borrowing costs on March 8, increasing its refinancing and discount rates to 12 percent each. That matched the level of the repurchase rate, which has been raised six times from 7 percent in early November. Thailand , the Philippines, India and South Korea also boosted rates in March to damp inflationary pressure, while China and Malaysia told lenders to set more cash aside in reserve. Indonesia paused after raising its benchmark to 6.75 percent last month, the next highest policy rate behind Vietnam’s among major Southeast Asian economies. The central bank devalued the dong for the fourth time in 15 months on Feb. 11 as it strives to narrow the nation’s trade deficit, which widened to $1.15 billion this month from a revised $1.11 billion in February. That contrasts with the rise in most Asian currencies against the dollar in the past year. Ratings Cut Officials have urged less use of gold and dollars in a bid to stabilize the currency as they try to steady the economy after Fitch Ratings , Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s cut Vietnam’s credit rating in 2010. The government has “recognized that their attention and focus should be on addressing instability even if this comes at the expense of slower growth,” the World Bank said in a report last week. Such policies, if successful, will help Vietnam “regain its pre-crisis growth potential in the medium term,” it said, predicting 6.3 percent expansion in 2011. Dung said last month he aims to curb credit growth to less than 20 percent this year from an earlier target of 23 percent. He also intends to narrow the budget deficit to less than 5 percent of GDP from a goal of about 6 percent in 2010, and cap the jump in money supply at 15 percent to 16 percent this year. Industry and construction, which accounted for 43 percent of the economy in the first quarter, grew 5.47 percent during the period from a year earlier, according to today’s report. Services, which made up 42 percent of GDP, expanded 6.28 percent. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries, which accounted for the remaining 15 percent of the economy, grew 2.05 percent. Economic Potential While accelerating inflation and the impact of Japan ’s worst earthquake threaten slower growth across Asia, some businesses are judging Vietnam’s potential outweighs challenges. Companies from Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones, to Wintek Corp. (2384) , a Taiwanese manufacturer of panels for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, are shifting production to the nation to benefit from cheaper labor compared with China. Taichung, Taiwan-based Wintek said last week it intends to invest as much as $150 million in a new plant in Bac Giang province in the north. Espoo, Finland-based Nokia plans to open a plant near Hanoi to make low-end phones. Overseas shipments climbed 25.5 percent last year to $71.63 billion, equivalent to about 75 percent of an economy that expanded 6.8 percent last year, the highest pace since 2007. Vinashin Shortcomings Dung is on course to serve another five-term after being reelected to the Communist Party’s top decision-making body in January. He earlier faced criticism over state-owned Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group, or Vinashin, which the government said in August risked bankruptcy. Dung and others acknowledge “shortcomings” in managing the company, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung said last week. Damping inflation without compromising growth “requires major structural reforms to correct imbalances,” including reducing the power of state-owned companies in the economy, said Le Anh Tu Packard, a West Chester, Pennsylvania-based economist at Moody’s Analytics. Bank lending rates are currently about 20 percent, according to Ho Chi Minh City-based Dragon Capital. That’s “just too high,” said Nguyen Thi Mai Thanh, general director of Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corp. (REE) , also based in Ho Chi Minh City and one of the first enterprises to list on Vietnam’s stock exchange when it opened in 2000. “When we decide not to borrow from the banks, it means we have to reduce our activities and control the ones we carry out more carefully,” Thanh said. --Jason Folkmanis in Ho Chi Minh City.

{"headline": "Carbon Projects Cancel Emission Credits for Doha Climate Talks", "article": "Emission-reduction projects have proposed to voluntarily cancel 25,000 metric tons of carbon credits to offset greenhouse gases from this month’s United Nations climate talks and to highlight plunging prices. The Project Developer Forum, a London-based lobby group for companies that cut heat-trapping gases in emerging nations, will send the credits to the Clean Development Mechanism registry’s voluntary cancellation account to offset estimated emissions from travel and accommodation of 10,000 participants at the talks in Doha, Qatar. The value of CERs has plunged 93 percent in the past two years, according to data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Credits for December fell 3.5 percent today to 82 euro cents ($1.05) a ton as of 12:49 p.m., ICE data show.

{"headline": "KenolKobil Targets African Expansion Amid Kenyan `Government Interference'", "article": "KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel retailer that operates in nine African nations, said it plans to make acquisitions in four more countries as part of a strategy to expand outside its home market. KenolKobil, based in Nairobi, is targeting the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia , Djibouti and Malawi, Patrick Kondo, head of mergers and acquisitions at the company, told reporters at a briefing today. “Some of them are at an advanced stage, some of them are in the early stages,” he said. KenolKobil, which has a 25 percent share of the Kenyan oil market, is expanding abroad amid what it calls “government interference” in the domestic oil industry. It has operations in Kenya, Uganda , Tanzania , Rwanda , Burundi, Zambia, Ethiopia , Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The state-owned Kenya Pipeline Co. was ordered by the country’s High Court in February to pay KenolKobil 5.2 billion shillings ($61.7 million) without interest for contravening a transportation and storage agreement. In October, KenolKobil said it settled a four-year dispute on pending claims against Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd., in which the government holds a 50 percent stake, over processing fees. KPRL said it was owed 600 million shillings by KenolKobil, which in turn said it was owed 5.3 billion shillings as a result of losses incurred after KPRL withheld refined oil and prevented two ships from delivering crude ordered by KenolKobil. ‘Reasonable Return’ Markets outside Kenya are “where we believe we can get a reasonable return on our investment without interference,” Managing Director Jacob Segman told reporters today. “Over time, Kenya is losing its net contribution to the bottom line.” He declined to say what proportion of the company’s current profit is generated outside Kenya. Last year, KenolKobil announced plans to expand in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The company has since acquired a 21,000 cubic- meter (741,608 cubic-feet) storage depot at the Mozambican port of Beira, and a liaison office in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, Kondo said. Initial operations in the two countries will involve importing fuel in bulk and selling it to fuel-marketing companies, he said. Kenya’s biggest fuel retailer by market value, KenolKobil last month acquired a fuel depot, a dry-goods warehouse and an office complex from Societe d’Importation et de Commercialisation de Petroliers in Burundi. In January, it bought the assets of Phoenix Uganda Petroleum Ltd., consisting of a fuel terminal, an office block and three gas stations. In the 12 months through December, non-fuel products contributed 10 percent to KenolKobil’s net income. The company plans to grow that contribution to 25 percent over the next six to 10 years, Segman said. To contact the reporter on this story: Eric Ombok in Nairobi at  eombok@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Polish Stocks Climb Most in Week as Mining Stocks Jump on Taxes", "article": "Polish stocks climbed for a second day, with the benchmark index heading for the biggest advance in in a week, as coal and copper producers jumped after a court ruling on mining taxes. The WIG20 Index increased 1.6 percent to 2,230.84 at 2:10 p.m. in Warsaw, trimming this week’s drop to 0.8 percent. Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB) , the country’s second-largest publicly traded coal producer, soared as much as 4.6 percent to 112.9 zloty, the biggest intraday gain in a week, and last traded 3.6 percent higher at 111.8 zloty. The company had reserves of 73 million zloty ($23 million) at the end of June for payments of a tax that was struck down by the Constitutional Tribunal, Tomasz Zieba, a spokesman for the company, said today. Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA rose for a second day, adding 1.2 percent to 97.7 zloty, after the European Union’s largest coking-coal producer said it may book financial gains of about 435 million zloty after the court ruled that mining excavations should not be considered as construction works and should be free of real-estate taxes. KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole copper-mining company, climbed 1.4 percent to 160 zloty, heading for the highest close this week. Dariusz Wyborski, a KGHM spokesman, had no immediate comment on the benefits for the company after the ruling. PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest lender, added 3.3 percent to 30.9 zloty, increasing for a second day, and Bank Pekao SA (PEO) advanced 2.1 percent to 131.9 zloty, extending yesterday’s 3.8 percent rally.

{"headline": "Australian Government Won't Be `Stampeded' by Retailers Over Online Sales", "article": "The Australian government won’t be “stampeded’ by retailers over the threat to businesses from goods sold by offshore websites, Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten said. ‘‘We respect the fact that large retailers have ongoing concerns,’’ Shorten told Bloomberg News today in an e-mail. ‘‘But we will not be stampeded into making rash decisions because of a vocal minority, especially when the majority of the sector and consumer groups support our sensible, measured approach.’’ Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s largest furniture and electrical retailer, and Premier Investments Ltd. , whose chairman, Solomon Lew, was a former executive chairman of Coles Myer Ltd., are among retailers who criticized a government inquiry into the future of retailing announced yesterday. They say the probe will be too slow to tackle the danger from the growth in online purchases from abroad. Prime Minister Julia Gillard ’s administration yesterday announced the inquiry into the impact of globalization on domestic retailers. It said the Productivity Commission will report its findings in 2011 as the government seeks to safeguard the future of an A$242 billion ($239 billion) industry. The Commission also plans to start a ‘‘compliance campaign” to ensure that sales taxes and customs duty concessions on imports aren’t being exploited, Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O’Connor said in yesterday’s statement. Too Late The inquiry will be completed “too late” to stop some retailers going out of business shortly after Christmas, Harvey Norman’s executive chairman Gerry Harvey said in a telephone interview yesterday. The Australian National Retailers Association -- which represents companies including Woolworths Ltd. , Australia’s biggest retailer, as well as Harvey Norman and others -- and the Australian Retailers Association, whose members are smaller companies, today backed the government’s approach. “We’re all trying to achieve the same end here,” ARA’s Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said by telephone from Sydney. “The government has taken a very holistic approach to this review, and I think to try and force the government’s hand without knowledge of what the actual problem is means you may end up fixing it the wrong way.” He said only about 3 percent of Australia’s retail market is currently affected by a problem that is nonetheless “growing exponentially.” The government “has taken seriously the concerns of the retail sector in difficult economic conditions,” ANRA’s Chief Executive Margy Osmond said in a statement e-mailed today. The associations together represent the bulk of Australia’s retailing industry. Evading Duty “You’ve got every second person in the country importing things from overseas, evading duty, not paying sales tax,” Harvey said yesterday. “It’s gaining momentum at a rapid rate. Rather than clip it in the bud, they’ll end up doing something about it, but it will be too late.” Premier Investments’ Lew, who has also been a Reserve Bank of Australia board member, echoed Harvey’s sentiments. “What we all agree on is that the Australian retail sector is hurting and the government appears to be on the side of the overseas retailers,” he said in an e-mail today. He called on the government to immediately abolish the sales tax for all purchases under the present A$1,000 threshold, rather than only in the case of offshore purchases. ‘All we’re asking for is an even playing field,’’ Lew said. “Then consumers really will see savings.” Premier is Australia’s largest specialty-clothing retailer. Australian Dollar The threat to retailers has been exacerbated by a strengthening currency, which has increased the spending power of consumers shopping overseas. The Australian dollar has advanced 18 percent since the end of June, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, reaching parity with the greenback in October for the first time since July 1982. “There is no denying that retailers are doing it tough,” Shorten said today. “But having no GST on a relatively small number of overseas imports is not the chief reason for slow retail in Australia. Other factors, including the high Australian dollar, ongoing aftershocks of the global financial crisis and the fact that Australians are simply spending less this Christmas are much larger concerns.” Harvey said an alliance of retailers has been formed to press the case. The group includes Westfield Group , the world’s largest owner of shopping centers, and Myers Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s biggest department store chain, the Weekend Australian newspaper reported yesterday. Ad Campaign The report said the alliance is planning newspaper and television advertisements similar to those used by the mining industry against a resources tax, which played a part in toppling former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. A separate article in the Weekend Australian said mining companies are planning new advertisements against the government, believing they were misled over the so-called mineral resources rent tax. “All certain people are doing at the moment is joining together to try and figure out what to do,” Harvey said. “If that means mounting an advertising campaign at the same time as the miners are going to do theirs or whatever, certainly if the government’s faced with a double onslaught like that, and the slightest little thing happens out there, see you later government.” To contact the reporter on this story: Shani Raja in Sydney at  sraja4@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Tighe at  ptighe@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "호주 정부가 소매업의 미래에 대한 조사를 발표한 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "해외 웹사이트에서 판매되는 상품으로 인한 위협에 대해 호주 정부가 소매업자들의 요구에 어떻게 대응하고 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "호주 소매업자들이 해외 구매 증가로 인한 위협에 대응하기 위해 어떤 전략을 고려하고 있으며, 정부의 정책과 어떻게 상호작용하고 있나요?"}]}
{"headline": "Wyly Brothers, Alcatel, BP, Roche, Facebook in Court News", "article": "Samuel Wyly and Charles Wyly, the Texan brothers and entrepreneurs who funded ads helping George W. Bush’s presidential campaigns, were sued by U.S. regulators who accused them of misleading investors while selling hundreds of millions of dollars in stock.  The Wylys used “an elaborate sham system of trusts and subsidiary companies” in the Isle of Man and Cayman Islands over a 13-year period to hide control of securities linked to companies where they were board members, the Securities and Exchange Commission said July 29 in a lawsuit filed in New York federal court. They illegally kept investors in the dark as they sold off holdings, and in one case made illegal insider trades, the SEC said.  “The cloak of secrecy has been lifted from the complex web of foreign structures used by the Wylys to evade the securities laws,” the SEC’s deputy enforcement director, Lorin Reisner, said in a statement. “They used these structures to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of gains in violation of the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders.”  The brothers “intend to vigorously defend themselves --and expect to be fully vindicated,” said their attorney, William A.

Barnes & Noble Files Lawsuits Against Alcatel, Xerox  Barnes & Noble Inc. , which makes the Nook electronic reader and sells books from its website, sued Xerox Corp. and Alcatel- Lucent SA over demands the bookseller pay royalties for patents.

Xerox says that barnesandnoble.com violates four its patents, the book seller said in a separate court filing July 29. Neither claim is valid, Barnes & Noble said in its lawsuit. It asked the court to rule in its favor.  “We filed the declaratory judgment actions to make clear, as outlined in the complaints, that we are not infringing any valid Xerox and Alcatel-Lucent patents,” Barnes & Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating said in an e-mail. “We cannot further comment on pending litigation.”  Mary Ward, a spokeswoman for Alcatel-Lucent, declined to comment in an e-mail.

Lawsuits/Pretrial  U.S. Justice Staff Said to Urge Subpoenas for BP Managers  U.S. Justice Department attorneys conducting a criminal probe of the BP Plc well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico have recommended that a grand jury be convened and BP managers subpoenaed to determine if any laws were broken, a person familiar with the investigation said.  The subpoenas also would target employees of rig operator Transocean Ltd. , said the person, who was briefed by the attorneys and asked not to be identified. London-based BP is the majority owner of the well that exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  Offshore drilling regulators from the Interior Department agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service would be summoned to testify about the process under which BP received permits to drill the well about 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the Louisiana coast, and whether any improper relationships existed between agency employees and the company, the person said.  Contractors that worked for BP and Transocean aboard the rig also might be compelled to testify, according to the person.  Senior Justice Department officials still have to approve a grand jury, which would be a special panel or one that sits regularly. The recommendations were made by department attorneys in Washington and New Orleans, the person said. The panel would probably meet in New Orleans, the person said.  Hannah August, a Justice Department spokeswoman, and Kathy English, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana, declined to comment.  For more, click here.  Fugitive Polly Peck Founder Granted Bail in London  Asil Nadir, the founder of Polly Peck International Plc who fled to northern Cyprus in 1993, can return to the U.K. on bail before standing trial in London for embezzling 30 million pounds ($47 million).  Nadir’s bid for bail was granted and he must attend court in London on Sept. 3, Judge David Bean said at a hearing July 30 at the Old Bailey criminal court. Within eight hours of returning to the U.K. he must be fitted with an electronic security tag, Bean said.  Nadir’s lawyer, William Clegg, told Bean his client had agreed with the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting the case, to return to London, surrender his passport, visit the police every week and attend his criminal trial.  “Mr. Nadir is today anxious to return to this country and face his trial,” Clegg said before the ruling. Nadir has already taken an option to rent an apartment in London, his lawyer said.  Nadir fled the U.K. after he was charged with theft and false accounting. Polly Peck was a food-packaging firm that collapsed in 1990 after it failed to pay creditors. Administrators found more than 700 million pounds were unrecoverable from the subsidiaries.  Victor Temple, a lawyer for the SFO, said during the hearing that the agency would not oppose bail if Nadir appeared in court to request it.  For the latest lawsuits news, click here.  Trials/Appeals  Singapore Death Penalty Book Author Won’t Apologize  Alan Shadrake, the British author charged for contempt of court for challenging the integrity and independence of Singapore’s judiciary, said he wouldn’t apologize for his book on the city’s death penalty.  “I want to have my day in court,” he said after his trial was adjourned July 30 to allow his lawyer more time to prepare a defense of fair criticism and fair comment. “I didn’t spend three years writing the book only to run away,” Shadrake said.  The 75-year-old writer is also being investigated for criminal defamation by Singapore authorities. His book “Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore’s Justice in the Dock,” suggests that the government “succumbs to political and economic pressures” in meting out the death penalty, the Attorney-General’s Chambers said in court papers.  Shadrake can “tender an unreserved apology in unqualified terms,” David Chong, chief counsel of the Attorney-General’s civil division, said in court July 30. “Justification is no defense” for contempt of court, Chong said.  Refusing to apologize would count as an“aggravating factor,” the Attorney-General’s office said in a statement July 30. “An apology tendered to the court, if unqualified and sincere, may mitigate the punishment,” according to the statement.  The book “insinuates that the Singapore judiciary is a tool of the People’s Action Party to muzzle political dissent” through the award of “heavy damages in defamation actions brought without legal basis,” the Attorney General’s office said in the court papers. The book contains comments that imply the Singapore judiciary was “guilty of impropriety” by being “biased particularly against the weak, poor or less educated,” according to the papers.  Shadrake’s lawyer M. Ravi asked Justice Quentin Loh to order Chong “not to put unnecessary fear in the media” after the prosecutor told journalists not to cite contentious statements from the book or risk being in contempt as well.  The case is Attorney-General v. Alan Shadrake OS720/2010 in the Singapore High Court.  For more, click here.  For the latest trial and appeals news, click here.  On the Docket  Roche Holding to Face Hollywood Stars in Accutane Trial  Roche Holding AG faces a lineup of Hollywood stars in the New Jersey trial of an actor’s lawsuit alleging he suffered the loss of his colon after taking the company’s Accutane acne drug.  James Marshall, who played U.S. Marine Louden Downey in the 1992 hit movie “A Few Good Men,” claims his acting career was derailed by his use of Accutane, which Roche no longer sells. Marshall will ask a jury to award at least $11 million in damages at a trial starting next week that will feature testimony from stars such as Martin Sheen and Brian Dennehy, according to court filings.  Sheen, Dennehy and Director Rob Reiner will testify that Marshall, 43, was headed for stardom before bowel ailments allegedly caused by Accutane forced doctors to remove his colon, Michael Hook, the actor’s lawyer, said in an interview. Basel, Switzerland-based Roche faces thousands of lawsuits claiming it failed to warn patients that the drug could cause inflammatory bowel disease in some users, Hook said.  “The jury will hear that James Marshall had the potential to be the next James Dean-like star,” Hook said. “That dream is gone because he took something to treat acne.”  Roche officials said July 30 that Accutane’s safety label contained a warning about the risks of inflammatory bowel disease for more than 20 years.  Marshall’s case has been combined with claims by two other former Accutane users for trial before Judge Carol Higbee in state court in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  The case is Greenblatt v. Hoffman-La Roche Inc., ATL-l- 1246-06, New Jersey Superior Court, Atlantic County (Atlantic City).  For more, click here.

{"headline": "Nokia Strengthens Symbian Phones Against Android in China", "article": "Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones by units, announced three Symbian smartphones equipped with an extra wireless technology called near-field communications to stem market share losses to Google Inc.’s Android. Within Asia there’s “a big requirement” for these types of products, Colin Giles, the company’s sales chief, said in an interview in Hong Kong. Giles is also the interim head for Nokia’s business in China, where he’s reorganizing operations after the company’s shipments in the country plummeted 41 percent last quarter to 11.3 million phones. Nokia is trying to extend its 10-year-old Symbian product line to maintain sales as it shifts to Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 7 operating system for high-end smartphones. The models announced today start at 180 euros ($260) and use NFC to communicate with nearby devices including other smartphones. Rivals using Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android system are already driving prices for low-end smartphones below 100 euros, further expanding the fastest-growing handset segment. “We have said we are transitioning to the Windows Phone, and that’s our overall objective,” Giles said in the interview. “At the same time we plan to continue to enhance the Symbian platform.” Nokia will continue rolling out updates to Symbian through next year, Giles said. He also reiterated commitments to support Symbian products to 2016. Android Sales Android was the best-selling smartphone operating system worldwide in the second quarter as sales rose more than fourfold to 43.3 percent of the market, led by Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. (2498) , according to Gartner Inc. Apple had an 18.2 percent share. Nokia’s handset revenue in China  fell 34 percent in the second quarter, helping trigger a profit warning, as retailers sold out overstock from the first quarter when revenue rose 30 percent. The company also faced softening demand in the Chinese market, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop said in the July 21 results presentation. Nokia replaced managers in China and named the 48-year-old Giles as interim head for the country. Giles had previously served as Nokia’s head of China and northeast Asia. “We have made a number of changes in our China business in the past couple of months, and some of the issues we announced a couple of months ago around challenges with our inventory have been fixed,” Giles said. “I can say today that our inventories are at healthy levels.” He declined to give a forecast for Nokia’s China sales. ‘Angry Birds’ The Espoo, Finland-based company accounted for 24 percent of China’s mobile-phone market by shipments in the second quarter, declining from 32.2 percent three months earlier, according to research company Analysys International. Second- placed Samsung’s market share increased to 21.6 percent from 21.4 percent, according to the Beijing-based researcher. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland , began including NFC hardware on mass-market handsets last year with the C7, sold in the U.S. as the Nokia Astound. NFC permits users to exchange photos and contacts directly, activate headsets and speakers by tapping them, bring up Web pages by tapping specially tagged posters, and access features in games. Google, Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , and other handset makers are also trying out NFC, some versions of which can be used for electronic payments. Nokia announced a previous update called “Symbian Anna” in April, adding a faster browser and a portrait-mode keyboard for touchscreens. That update shipped on two new devices this summer and was rolled out to existing users of N8 family devices on Aug. 18. The company said in February it aimed to sell 150 million more Symbian handsets.

{"headline": "Chrysler Reports $436 Million Second-Quarter Profit", "article": "Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker controlled by Fiat SpA (F) , reported second-quarter net income of $436 million as the company plans to extend gains in passenger- car sales with the new Dodge Dart compact. The quarterly profit compared with a year-earlier loss of $370 million, the Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said yesterday in a statement. Chrysler’s second-quarter 2011 results included a one-time $551 million cost for repaying government loans. Sales increased 23 percent to $16.8 billion. Chrysler affirmed its forecast that net income will rise to about $1.5 billion this year, buoying results for its Turin, Italy-based majority owner as Europe ’s debt crisis sends sales in the region to a fifth-consecutive drop. Chrysler’s U.S. sales of passenger cars surged 42 percent during the second quarter from a year earlier, driven by demand for 200 and 300 sedans, according to researcher Autodata Corp. “Chrysler really has hit the ball out of the park here in the first half, gaining additional market share in the U.S.,” Richard Hilgert, an analyst for Morningstar Equity Research, said in a telephone interview before the results were released. The results “could mean potential upside” for Fiat’s earnings, Hilgert, who is based in Chicago , said in an e-mail after Chrysler’s statement. The Italian automaker may say that earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items, which it calls trading profit , surged 82 percent to 957.8 million euros ($1.17 billion) for the second quarter, the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Shares Drop Fiat shares traded down 6 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 4.13 euros as of 12:28 p.m. in Milan today, ahead of the carmaker’s earnings release later this afternoon. The shares have climbed 16 percent this year. “When Fiat reports its numbers, we will see how better cash generation at Chrysler will translate into the group net debt figure,” said Erich Hauser, an analyst with Credit Suisse in London. Chrysler results were below his estimates, he said. Chrysler reported it had $12.1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, up from $11.3 billion as of March 31. Net industrial debt dropped to $432 million from $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Chrysler’s car sales gains probably will continue in the second half because of the Dart, which will reach full inventory at dealers by September, Hilgert said. “Our portfolio became more balanced with our car mix increasing on a year-over-year basis, showing that our car offerings are becoming more competitive,” Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler and Fiat, said in an e-mail to employees. “We are building on this trend, as the all-new Dodge Dart began arriving at dealerships during the second quarter.” Merger Plans Marchionne plans to merge the two companies and increase sales to more than 100 billion euros by 2014. Fiat will boost its ownership stake of Chrysler to 61.8 percent by exercising an option to buy an additional 3.3 percent from the United Auto Workers’ retiree health-care trust, or VEBA, the company said in a July 3 statement. An initial public offering for Chrysler is unlikely to be a 2012 event, “if it’s an event at all,” Marchionne said on an April 26 conference call. The slump in financial markets and valuations of competing automakers make it unlikely that Fiat and the VEBA, which owns the remainder of Chrysler, will reach an agreement clearing the way for a full merger of the automakers in the near term, Morningstar’s Hilgert said. “With the markets being where they are at this point and auto stocks not really being at the valuations that we saw maybe a year and a half ago or so, the two probably aren’t going to meet at this point in terms of valuation,” he said. 300 Sedan Chrysler Group’s total U.S. sales rose 30 percent from a year earlier to 834,068 cars and light trucks during the first half, according to Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata. Sales of the Chrysler brand’s 200 more than doubled and 300 sedans almost tripled in the first half from a year earlier. The company topped the industry’s 15 percent increase, boosted by demand for redesigned or refreshed models such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle. Chrysler’s U.S. market share rose 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 11.5 percent, Autodata said. Fiat’s first-quarter operating losses in Europe almost doubled to 207 million euros. Marchionne said this month that the company will shut another plant in Italy after closing one in Sicily last year unless it can come up with a viable plan to use excess capacity to build cars for North America. Fiat has delayed the introduction of new models in Europe and is cutting investment in the region by 500 million euros. Chrysler probably will continue to offset slumping results for Fiat “at least through 2013” because of Europe’s market conditions and Italy’s austerity measures, Hilgert said.

{"headline": "Brazil Real Falls to Four-Year Low on Fed, Sparking Intervention", "article": "Brazil’s real dropped to a four-year low, prompting the central bank to intervene for a third day this week to stem the selloff after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled yesterday that it may taper monetary stimulus. The currency slid for a fifth day, depreciating 1.5 percent to 2.2575 per U.S. dollar , the weakest on a closing basis since April 2009. The real and the Mexican peso are the worst performers in the past month among 24 emerging-market dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. The Ibovespa (IBOV) equity index rose 0.7 percent today after sinking into a bear market on June 11. Mexico’s IPC tumbled 3.9 percent. The real extended its one-month decline to 9.6 percent, which would be the biggest since September 2011. The currency pared its drop today as the central bank sold $2.99 billion of foreign-exchange swap contracts in the seventh day of intervention in three weeks. It also offered $3 billion at two auctions of currency credit lines. “It’s very hard to actually impact the currency on a sustainable basis,” Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia , said in a phone interview from Toronto. “As long as they keep doing swaps, I think they can slow it but not stop it. They face a really challenging situation.” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday that policy makers may start winding down the pace of asset purchases later in 2013 and may end them around the middle of next year. Risks to the outlook for the U.S. economy and the labor market have diminished, the Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Washington. Treasury Buybacks Brazil’s Treasury bought back local fixed-rate and inflation-linked bonds today to bolster demand for the securities amid a market rout fueled by the speculation the Fed will pare back stimulus. Today’s repurchase offer was the third unscheduled one in a week. Yesterday’s auction produced no buybacks, the Treasury said. The Treasury said it bought back 239,000 inflation-linked NTN-Bs, 600,000 fixed-rate NTN-Fs and 402,500 fixed-rate LTNs, The government will offer to repurchase more bonds tomorrow. Yields on fixed-rate bonds due in 2023, among the securities the Treasury is offering to buy, have soared 1.35 percentage points this month to 11.88 percent, the highest level since Brazil began selling them last year. “The Treasury is doing its best to calm the market,” Ricardo Tibau, a fixed-income trader at Renascenca DTVM, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. Moody’s View Lackluster growth and rising debt levels in Brazil are making it “more difficult to support” the positive outlook on the nation’s Baa2 credit rating, Mauro Leos , senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service, said yesterday in a phone interview from New York. Standard & Poor’s cut the outlook on its equivalent BBB rating for Brazil to negative on June 6. Swap rates due in January climbed 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to a 14-month high of 9.10 percent today on speculation that a weakening real will spur the central bank to maintain the pace of increases in borrowing costs. Annual inflation accelerated for nine straight months through March to 6.59 percent, exceeding the upper end of the monetary authority’s target range of 2.50 percent to 6.50 percent. The inflation rate eased to 6.49 percent in April and was 6.50 percent in May. A series of street protests showed little sign of abating after officials in Brazil’s two largest cities bowed to popular demand and canceled an increase in bus fares. The central bank raised its target lending rate by 50 basis points on May 29 to 8 percent to curb inflation, surprising 38 of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who had expected a second straight increase of 25 basis points.

{"headline": "Berkshire to Pay CaixaBank $780 Million in Reinsurer Bet", "article": "Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to pay 600 million euros ($780 million) to reinsure a book of individual life policies at CaixaBank SA (CABK) , Spain ’s third-biggest lender. CaixaBank will book a one-time 524 million-euro pretax gain from the deal with Berkshire, the Barcelona-based lender said in a filing to regulators in Madrid today. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire will get future profits from the portfolio, which generated premium revenue of 231 million euros last year, according to a spokesman for the bank who asked not to be identified in line with company policy. Berkshire has profited as a source of liquidity during times of crisis, including deals in 2008 to inject $5 billion into Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and assume liability for a portion of coverage written by Swiss Re Ltd. New European regulations and the region’s debt crisis may push some companies to cede risk or raise capital, Greenlight Capital Re Ltd., the reinsurer that counts David Einhorn as its chairman, has said. “The current problems being caused by the debt crisis and other economic problems, will certainly create opportunities,” Greenlight Re Chief Executive Officer Bart Hedges said on a February conference call. “We think that we’ll be able to find good partners that need capital support.” Spanish banks are raising funds to bolster their balance sheets as they absorb losses from a government-ordered cleanup of their real estate assets. CaixaBank said last month it made 4.41 billion euros of provisions in the first nine months of the year to fully cover the 2.44 billion-euro requirements of a decree from February and 600 million euros of the 2.1 billion euros in charges it needs to make under another decree from May. Insurance Float The lender’s VidaCaixa unit will continue to service the policies. Buffett built Berkshire over more than four decades as CEO from a failing textile maker into a company that sells insurance, hauls freight, generates electricity and operates manufacturing and retail businesses. The company had $47.8 billion (BRK/A) in cash at the end of September. The billionaire has used insurance premiums held before claims payments are made to fund investments and acquisitions. The so-called float climbed to more than $70 billion last year from $39 million in 1970.

{"headline": "German Company-Car Study Urges Government to Cut Subsidies", "article": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government should change the way it taxes company cars to reduce revenue loss through subsidies and cut harmful emissions, a study commissioned by the Environment Ministry said. The government should replace the current system that taxes the private use of company cars based on their list price with a system based on the purchase price and kilometers traveled, according to the study by the Cologne-based Fifo economic institute posted on its website. The revised rules should also discourage companies from buying cars that use a lot of gasoline, it said. Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Daimler AG (DAI) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) fell at least 2 percent earlier today after the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper carried a report on the study. European carmakers slid as much as 2.4 percent as a group, the worst performance among 19 industry groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Even so, the study envisaged a “rather limited impact” on the industry. “There will be fewer trips, but company car users are unlikely to give up their cars altogether,” it said. The study doesn’t reflect any “current initiative” by Merkel’s government, Elke Mayer, a spokeswoman for the Environment Ministry in Berlin, said by phone. The ministry is examining the study and hasn’t reached any conclusions, she said. Cut Revenue Loss The overhauled system would reduce revenue loss from the subsidization of company-car use by as much as 4.6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) per year, generate as much as 900 million euros in social-insurance contributions and cut emissions by as much as 5.7 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to the study. The report echoes the 2009 coalition agreement between the parties in Merkel’s government, in which they agreed to review the “appropriateness” of the taxation of the private use of company cars. Of the 2.1 million cars sold in Germany per year on average between 2007 and 2009, 1.1 million were company cars, of which 750,000 were used privately, the study said. Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, closed 1.7 percent lower in Frankfurt at 132.50 euros. BMW fell 1.7 percent to 63.37 euros. Daimler, the world’s biggest makers of luxury cars, fell 1.6 percent to 51.65 euros.

{"headline": "Yield Below Sweden Curbs Demand in Czech Government Bond Auction", "article": "The Czech Republic sold the minimum planned amount of new 3 1/2-year bonds at today’s auction as yields below higher-rated Sweden damped investor demand. The country issued 3 billion koruna ($157 million) of notes due in July 2016, compared with a target of 3 billion koruna to 5 billion koruna, central bank data shows. Investors bid for 4.6 billion koruna of the debt, rated A1 at Moody’s Investors Service, and the average accepted yield was 0.63 percent. Top- rated Swedish bonds of the same maturity yield 1.1 percent. Optimism that Europe will contain its economic crisis is pushing bondholders to lower-rated debt offering higher returns from Spain to Hungary. The Czech Finance Ministry today also sold 3.8 billion koruna of bonds maturing in 2022, near the top of the 2 billion koruna to 4 billion koruna plan. Bids totaled 8 billion koruna and the yield was 1.96 percent, compared with similar securities trading at 1.82 percent in Sweden and 1.51 percent in Germany , data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Shorter Czech yields are no longer competitive,” Marek Drimal, an economist at Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) in Prague , said by phone after the auction. “Demand for the longer bond was solid because it still offers a nice yield premium.” Czech bonds have the highest credit ratings in central and eastern Europe, on par with Estonia, and are the cheapest to insure with credit-default swaps. The Czech swaps fell one basis point today to 58, after touching a three-year low of 57 on Jan. 4. The contracts for France traded at 85 today. The swaps, which drop as perceptions of creditworthiness improve, pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. ’Safe Haven’ The koruna gained less than 0.1 percent today to 25.599 per euro by 2:55 a.m. in Prague. Demand for Czech debt surged after the government curbed sales in the last quarter of 2012 and said its gross borrowing this year will fall by about 25 percent to 230.7 billion koruna ($12.5 billion). The Finance Ministry doubled its cash reserve to about 140 billion koruna last year, a “sufficient cushion in the event of market instability,” Petr Pavelek, head of the ministry’s debt-management department, said on Dec. 12. Lower-than-expected borrowing costs helped trim the central government’s budget deficit to 101 billion koruna last year compared with the target of 105 billion koruna, Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said on Jan. 3. That is ’’credit positive’’ and supports the perception of the Czech Republic as “a regional safe haven,” Moody’s analysts Jaime Reusche in New York and Dietmar Hornung in Frankfurt wrote in a Jan. 8 research note. The A1 rating is Moody’s fifth-highest grade, four steps above Italy and five above Spain. “The ministry is in a comfortable situation thanks to its high financing reserve,” Komercni Banka ’s Drimal said. “Yields are likely to rise in future auctions as investors are leaving safe-haven bonds and hunting for higher returns elsewhere.” To contact the reporter on this story: Krystof Chamonikolas in Prague at  kchamonikola@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Wojciech Moskwa at  wmoskwa@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "체코 공화국의 채권 경매에서 투자자들의 수요가 감소한 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "체코 공화국의 채권 수익률이 스웨덴의 채권 수익률보다 낮은 상황에서, 투자자들이 체코 채권을 매입하는 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "체코 공화국의 채권 경매 결과가 해당 국가의 경제 상황과 재정 정책에 대해 어떤 시사점을 제공하나요?"}]}
{"headline": "Health-Care Law Upheld as Constitutional by Judge in First Legal Victory", "article": "A U.S. judge upheld the constitutionality of the health-care overhaul President Barack Obama signed in March, rejecting an argument by a self-described Christian law center in the first court victory for the new law. U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh in Detroit today denied the Thomas More Law Center ’s request for an injunction against the law and said the group failed to prove the statute is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. Steeh also rejected a challenge to the provision that imposes a financial penalty for having no insurance. “The minimum coverage provision, which addresses economic decisions regarding health-care services that everyone eventually, and inevitably, will need, is a reasonable means of effectuating Congress’s goal,” Steeh wrote. Today’s court ruling is the first to uphold the constitutionality of the law, which Michigan and 20 other states are challenging in separate lawsuits. A U.S. judge in Virginia already has refused to dismiss a claim seeking to overturn the law, and a federal judge in Florida said he is inclined to do the same. Steeh rejected claims by the U.S. that the Thomas More center didn’t have standing and that the case wasn’t ready for litigation. The government had said the court had no justification for hearing the lawsuit because the insurance requirement won’t take effect until 2014. ‘Essential Part’ “It certainly appears that the government has an interest in knowing sooner, rather than later, whether an essential part of its program regulating the national health care market is constitutional, although in this case it is not the government asking for the review,” Steeh wrote. Robert Muise, an attorney for Thomas More, said he will appeal today’s ruling. The center, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is dedicated to the “defense and promotion of the religious freedom of Christians,” according to its website. The law center, the plaintiff in the Michigan case along with four uninsured individuals, argued before Steeh in July that the statute creates a tax, in the form of compulsory insurance, that Congress lacks the power to enact. The center also claimed the law would violate religious freedoms by using its members’ tax dollars to pay for abortions. ‘Reasonable Means’ “The court found that the minimum coverage provision of the statute was a reasonable means for Congress to take in reforming our health-care system,” Tracy Schmaler , a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington, said in an e-mailed statement. “The department will continue to vigorously defend this law in ongoing litigation.” States seeking to overturn the law, including Michigan, claim its requirement that Americans buy health insurance exceeds the authority given to Congress by the Constitution. The U.S. contends Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce allows it to impose mandatory insurance premiums because $43 billion in unpaid medical bills are absorbed each year into a national market. A federal judge in Pensacola, Florida, has said he will decide by next week whether to throw out that state’s lawsuit challenging the law. He said he probably will allow at least part of it to proceed. Michigan is a plaintiff in that case. Another suit, brought in Virginia, survived an initial motion to dismiss and faces further arguments on Oct. 18. The case is Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 10cv11156, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). To contact the reporter on this story: William McQuillen in Washington at  bmcquillen@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Guillen Ousted as Marlins Manager After Team Finishes Last", "article": "Ozzie Guillen was ousted as manager of the Miami Marlins after the Major League Baseball team finished last in the National League’s five-team East division. The franchise hasn’t qualified for the playoffs since beating the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series as the Florida Marlins. The team finished this season with a 69-93 record, 29 games behind division-champion Washington, after signing shortstop Jose Reyes and other high-priced free agents and moving into a $515 million retractable-roof stadium. Guillen, who led the Chicago White Sox to a World Series title in 2005, spent one season with the Marlins and had three years left on his contract. “After careful consideration following the disappointment of the 2012 season, we decided to dismiss Ozzie,” Larry Beinfest, the Marlins’ president of baseball operations, said in a statement. “Our managerial search begins immediately and our hope is that a new manager, along with roster improvements, will restore a winning culture.” Guillen’s relationship with team owner Jeffrey Loria was tumultuous. Loria suspended Guillen for five games this season for remarks supporting former Cuban President Fidel Castro. Guillen later apologized. On Sept. 21, Guillen criticized the team’s performance to reporters while in New York and said Loria needed to “look in the mirror” and ask why the team has had so many managers. The Marlins have had six managers since Loria bought the team in 2002. Guillen, 48, signed a four-year, $10 million contract in September to manage the Marlins, who opened their stadium in Miami’s Little Havana section this season. Free Agents The team spent almost $200 million on free agents this year, including $106 million on Reyes and $58 million on pitcher Mark Buehrle , and still failed to challenge for a playoff spot. Guillen also feuded with players throughout the season. Relief pitcher Heath Bell, who signed a $27 million free-agent contract before the season, told Miami radio station WQAM on Sept. 25 that the team needed a manager that everybody “respects and looks up to.” Bell, who lost his closer’s job with the Marlins, was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Oct. 20. In April, Guillen, a Venezuela native who has lived in the Miami area for a decade, was quoted in Time magazine as saying “I love Fidel Castro.” He then clarified his comments, according to the magazine. “I respect Fidel Castro ,” Guillen told Time. “You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last 60 years, but that mother-----r is still here.” The population of Miami-Dade County, which helped fund the Marlins’ ballpark after a decade of negotiations, is 34 percent Cuban, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. In the city of Miami, where Marlins Park is located, there are 137,301 people of Cuban origin out of a total population of 399,457, also 34 percent. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez was among those who condemned Guillen’s remarks. Guillen was manager of the White Sox for eight years, compiling a 678-617 record.

The election was held a month after the country’s Constitutional Court approved Wade’s bid to extend his 12 years in office. Opposition groups including Mouvement 23 said his candidacy violated a rule limiting presidential terms to two. Wade said the rule didn’t apply to him because he was already in office when it was enacted. M23 was among the groups that organized days of protests which turned violent amid clashes with police, leaving at least nine dead, according to Amnesty International. “Macky Sall will need to go and see the other candidates to get their blessing and become the chosen candidate of the M23 coalition,” said Abdou Fall, Senegal analyst with Pretoria , South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies. “If he is going to win, he will need their support,” he said by phone from Dakar. Appeal Sall was prime minister from 2004 to 2008. He pledged to boost growth in Senegal’s $13 billion economy by attracting investors and cutting corruption in an interview Feb. 12. He told reporters yesterday that he would lower presidential mandates to five years from the current seven years if he wins. Wade must earn the support of Senegalese who decided not to vote, Fall said, putting the figure at around 40 percent. “If he can appeal to these people, he has a chance.” The yield on Senegal ’s $500 million Eurobonds dropped for a second day, falling 8 basis points to 8.607 percent late yesterday in London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Voting was “held in acceptable conditions of freedom and transparency,” said Koffi Sama, former prime minister of Togo and head of the Economic Community of West African States’ observer mission. “No major incidents or irregularities” were found, he said in a Feb. 27 statement. The tension that led to weeks of protest has eased, said Fall. “There is a sense of resignation and a feeling of satisfaction that there is going to be a second round,” he said.

{"headline": "WTI Crude Rises to Nine-Month High on Syrian Conflict", "article": "West Texas Intermediate crude climbed to a nine-month high as the Syrian conflict bolstered concern that the flow of supplies from the Middle East may be disrupted and on signs that economic growth is accelerating. Futures advanced 0.7 percent to the highest settlement since Sept. 14. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to sign a statement at the Group of Eight summit calling for the establishment of a “transitional government” in Syria. Reports showed that permits to build single-family homes in the U.S. rose to a five-year high in May. WTI’s discount to Brent oil traded in London shrank to the narrowest level since 2011. “Geopolitical concerns are on the minds of investors and continue to push prices higher,” said John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “In addition to the tensions in the Middle East, there’s positive economic news. The economic outlook is improving and that’s supportive for oil.” WTI crude for July delivery increased 67 cents to settle at $98.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 11 percent below the 100-day average at 4:34 p.m. Prices were little changed after the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. inventories fell 4.29 million barrels last week to 392 million. The July contract rose 72 cents to $98.49 a barrel at 4:33 p.m. The contract traded at $98.40 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m. Brent Futures Brent oil for August settlement climbed 55 cents, or 0.5 percent, to end the session at $106 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement since April 9. Volume for all contracts was 38 percent below the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade shrank to a $7.35 premium to WTI based on August contracts, the narrowest using closing prices since January 2011. U.S. equities increased for a second day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 percent. Backed by Lebanon’s Shiite militia Hezbollah and aid from Iran and Russia , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s troops have shifted the momentum of the civil war with an offensive against the rebels. President Barack Obama ratcheted up U.S. support for the opposition last week with a decision to send them arms. Russian Statement Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters at the summit in Lough Erne, Northern Ireland , that the G-8 communique on Syria won’t set a deadline for forming a new body with executive powers. Ryabkov said statements from the U.S. and U.K. that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons were “groundless” and warned that providing arms to the Syrian rebels will be a major blow to the chances for peace. The Middle East accounted for 33 percent of global crude output in 2012, according to BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy. Syrian oil exports, which were never among the highest in the region, have almost completely ended. Syria borders Iraq, the second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Iranian President-elect Hassan Rohani said yesterday that he’ll make the country’s nuclear program more transparent as he seeks to ease tension with the U.S. and reduce “brutal” sanctions. The U.S. and its allies suspect Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons, while the Islamic republic insists its atomic program is to generate electricity. Applications to build one-family homes in the U.S. rose 1.3 percent to a 622,000 pace, the fastest since May 2008, the Commerce Department reported today in Washington. Housing starts climbed 6.8 percent to a 914,000 annualized rate. Low Inflation The cost of living in the U.S. rose less than forecast in May, signaling inflation remains under control. The consumer price index was up 0.1 percent after falling 0.4 percent in April, the Labor Department reported today in Washington. The median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of 0.2 percent. The lack of inflation gives Federal Reserve policy makers, meeting today and tomorrow in Washington, more leeway to address unemployment as they consider whether to dial down their record monetary stimulus. “ Oil prices are solid,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “Today’s numbers show that we’re looking at modest economic growth without inflation. The Fed won’t have to reign in stimulus since inflation is under control.” The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim , Germany , said its index of German investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six months in advance, increased to 38.5 from 36.4 in May. U.S. Stockpiles The U.S. government will probably report tomorrow that crude supplies fell last week as refineries bolstered operating rates, a Bloomberg survey showed. Stockpiles declined 500,000 barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates in a survey conducted before the release of Energy Information Administration data. Refinery operation rates probably increased 0.5 percentage point to 88 percent. “The oil market remains vulnerable,” said Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “We have ample supplies and weak demand, which isn’t a good recipe for $100 oil.” Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in August was 18.6 percent, compared with 18.9 percent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 475,711 contracts as of 4:35 p.m. It totaled 623,501 contracts yesterday, 3 percent above the three-month average. Open interest was 1.86 million contracts, down from the previous session’s record 1.861 million.

{"headline": "News Corp. Ordered to Pay Coulson’s Phone-Hacking Legal Fees", "article": "Andy Coulson , the former press chief to U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron , won an appeal forcing News Corp. (NWSA) to pay his legal fees in phone-hacking and bribery cases linked to his editorship at the News of the World tabloid. Coulson’s 2007 termination contract, which had provisions for covering future legal expenses, requires News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. publisher to cover his costs linked to criminal charges because the allegations relate to his past duties at the title, the Court of Appeal ruled in London today. The accord was signed a month after two of the tabloid’s employees were sentenced to prison for phone-hacking offenses related to the royal family. “A defense to criminal charges cannot have been outside the contemplation of the parties” because the contract was signed with an editor “on whose watch interception of communications offenses had been carried out,” a panel of three judges said in the ruling. Refusing to pay such fees would “deprive the indemnity of all practical use.” Coulson, 44, was charged in July with conspiring between 2000 and 2006 to intercept the mobile-phone messages of more than 600 people, including U.S. actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. He was charged Nov. 20 with bribing public officials for stories. Rebekah Brooks, who stepped down as chief executive officer of the U.K. unit two days before her arrest last year, was also charged in the cases. Coulson’s lawyer, Jo Rickards of DLA Piper, declined to comment on the judgment. Daisy Dunlop , a spokeswoman for News Corp.’s U.K. unit, News International, didn’t return a call for comment. Hacking Scandal The ruling comes one day before a judge-led inquiry into press ethics that was triggered by the hacking scandal will issue a report on the U.K. media’s relationship with the public, police and politicians. News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch closed the News of the World in July 2011 in response to public anger over revelations that journalists accessed messages on a murdered schoolgirl’s mobile phone nearly a decade earlier. The investigation spawned parallel probes of computer hacking and bribery and led to the arrests of more than 80 people, including the unit’s former head of security and its top lawyer. Coulson started incurring costs in January 2011, when the Metropolitan Police Service opened a new probe into phone hacking in response to evidence the earlier case failed to uncover everyone involved. While News International initially paid Coulson’s legal costs, it refused shortly after his arrest in July last year. A lower court ruled in December 2011, before Coulson was charged, that News Corp. wasn’t required to pay his legal fees and ordered him to pay the company’s legal costs in the case. Coulson resigned from News International in 2007, after Mulcaire and the tabloid’s Royal Family reporter Clive Goodman were jailed for phone hacking. The ex-editor quit as Coulson’s aide last year when he was implicated in the new probe.

The $363 million loan on the building, the tallest in the U.S. Southeast, was transferred yesterday to special servicer LNR Partners from Wells Fargo & Co ., according to New York-based credit-rating company Fitch Ratings. “BentleyForbes requested the loan for Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta to be moved to special servicing to begin the process of reviewing options on the underlying capital structure ,” Tony Manos, the company’s chief operating officer, said today in a statement.

{"headline": "Spain Debt Reaches Record as Rajoy Becomes Crisis Focus: Economy", "article": "Spain ’s public-debt burden surged to the most in at least two decades, underlining concerns about its ability to reorder state finances as contagion from the debt crisis focuses on the euro area’s fourth-biggest economy. The nation’s overall debt last year amounted to 68.5 percent of gross domestic product, exceeding the government’s forecast of 67.3 percent, data on the Bank of Spain’s website showed today. That compares with 66 percent in the third quarter and 61.2 percent at the end of 2010. “Spain seems to be the main risk in the near future for Europe ,” Stephane Deo, chief European economist at UBS AG, wrote in a note today. “There are enormous challenges ahead, including the debt-recession spiral in Portugal and Spain.” Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy spooked investors on March 2 when he defied European colleagues by loosening his deficit target for 2012 amid the second recession in as many years. Even as the European Central Bank ’s loans to banks prop up demand for Spanish bonds, the nation’s borrowing costs have risen 30 basis points since Rajoy’s comments. The increase in Spanish debt was driven by the nation’s 17 semi-autonomous regional governments, whose borrowings swelled 17 percent from a year earlier as they overshot their budget- deficit goals. Debt Forecast The European Commission forecasts that Spain’s debt will have almost doubled to 78 percent of GDP by next year from where it was when Europe’s sovereign debt crisis began, as the country’s deficit-reduction efforts are hobbled by a relapse into recession. The International Monetary Fund expects the economy to contract 1.7 percent this year. Euro-area finance chiefs agreed this week that Spain’s deficit goal for 2012 was unachievable after the shortfall came in at 8.5 percent of GDP last year, compared with a 6 percent target. For 2012, European finance ministers agreed to ease the goal to 5.3 percent from an initial 4.4 percent. “So far the government has disappointed,” UBS’s Deo said. “An ambitious reduction of the deficit is needed.” Elsewhere today, minutes of last month’s Bank of Japan meeting showed that board members are concerned that increased bond purchases by the central bank may be viewed as financing government deficit spending. They said it was important “to clearly recognize and explain to the public” that the purchases are not “for the purpose of monetization,” according to the document released on the BOJ website. Singapore Exports Also in Asia , data in Singapore showed exports rebounded in February as shipments of pharmaceuticals and electronics surged. Non-oil domestic exports increased 30.5 percent from a year earlier, after a revised 2.4 percent drop in January, the trade promotion agency said in a statement. The median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 16.2 percent gain. In Europe, data from the European Union’s statistics office showed that exports rose for a third month in January, adding to signs the region’s economy is regaining strength after shrinking in the fourth quarter. Exports from the euro-area advanced a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent from December, when they increased 0.9 percent.

{"headline": "U.S. Meat-Industry Proposal May Cut Jobs, Boost Costs, Lobbying Group Says", "article": "A U.S. Department of Agriculture proposal to boost competition in meat processing may eliminate 104,000 jobs and boost retail costs by 3.3 percent, a meatpacker lobbying group said. About 30,000 jobs would be lost among farmers, processors and other groups directly related to the meat industry, while 74,000 jobs in “supplier and ancillary industries” will be cut, according to a study released today by the American Meat Institute. Consumer costs would increase by $2.7 billion from $80.6 billion spent annually on meat. The rule, proposed by the USDA in June, would require meatpackers to justify their choice of one farmer supplier over another. This may make packers vulnerable to lawsuits, spurring them to eliminate most marketing contracts with producers, said Mark Dopp , the institute’s general counsel. The study assumes prices that meatpackers pay for livestock will mirror spot markets, which are more volatile and would boost costs, he said. “The way this rule is written is going to fundamentally change packer behavior,” Dopp said on a conference call with reporters. “It is going to largely make marketing agreements go away.” The proposed rule would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by $14 billion, and federal, state and local governments would face $1.36 billion in lost tax revenue, according to the Washington-based group. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s biggest pork processor, and Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken processor, are members. ‘Fair Shake’ The USDA is accepting comments on the proposed rule and cannot comment on the lobbying group’s study, agency spokesman Caleb Weaver said. “USDA has a responsibility to look out for all of our farmers and make sure that the playing field is as level as it can possibly be, so that farmers and ranchers of all sizes get a fair shake,” Weaver said in an e-mail. “We will take all of the comments we receive very seriously.” Bill Bullard , the chief executive officer of producer group R-CALF USA, said the economic impact will be “minimal” because “absolutely no language” in the rule prohibits packers from entering marketing accords with producers. The institute “grossly over-exaggerated any costs,” he said in a telephone interview from Billings, Montana. “This study is based on the premise that packers will decide not to participate in marketing programs,” Bullard said. “We believe that is nothing but a hollow threat to prevent packers from disclosing information about their cattle- procurement practices.” There are about 950,000 cattle farms in the U.S., compared with 1.6 million in 1980, and the hog industry has declined to 71,000 farms from 666,000, according to the USDA. The average poultry grower makes about 34 cents per bird, while processing companies make about $3.23 per bird, the USDA said.

{"headline": "Rajoy Seeks Formula for Spanish Banks in Talks With EU Leaders", "article": "Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he’s talking to other European leaders about how to shore up the country’s banks as a lawmaker said the industry may need a $126 billion international bailout. Rajoy said he wouldn’t give estimates on how much capital the nation’s lenders need until he has reports from two international consultants, due this month, and from the International Monetary Fund , due on June 11. “After that I will give my figure and the government will say what the system needs to be recapitalized,” he told a news conference with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in Madrid today. “I’ve been talking to my European Union colleagues, and to Prime Minister Rutte, to take a decision on this matter.” European stocks rose today after China cut interest rates and amid speculation that leaders of the 17-member euro region are preparing a rescue operation tailored to Spain, which has been struggling to shore up its banking system. Rajoy is pushing against German opposition to changing the rules of Europe’s rescue mechanisms to allow them to recapitalize banks directly. Spanish banks may need as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) in aid which could be funneled through the nation’s bank-bailout fund, Antonio Lopez Isturiz, the general secretary of the European People’s Party, said today in an interview with TVE in Madrid. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday that the stress-test reports from Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman will be ready in the next 10 to 15 days. Spain’s 10-year bond yield fell to 6.088 percent today from 6.282 percent yesterday -- retreating from the 7 percent threshold that triggered bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- after the Treasury met its issuance goal at a bond auction.

{"headline": "Goldman Sachs Allowed to Move Murals to Build London Offices", "article": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will be allowed to move a set of protected murals from a building in the City of London financial district, a decision that may clear the way for the investment bank’s new European headquarters. The vote by the City’s council gives a Goldman Sachs unit the option to develop an office building at 70 Farringdon Street, about a minute’s walk from its existing London headquarters on Fleet Street. Planning permission for a 54,400-square-meter (585,500- square-foot) office development at the Farringdon Street site was first granted in 2005 and renewed in September 2011. The murals, nine semi-abstract ceramic panels by artist Dorothy Annan, were listed for preservation last year and “incorporate stylistic images of telecommunications equipment,” according to documents given to council members in advance of the vote. Goldman Sachs had been “somewhat concerned that their development may be scuppered” by having to keep the murals in place, Peter Rees, chief planning officer for the City of London , told council member’s today. Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London, declined to comment. The murals will initially be stored and may eventually be displayed near the Guildhall School of Music, about a mile from the Farringdon Street site, the documents provided to the council said. Goldman Sachs’ new office building is unlikely to be a suitable location for the murals “at least in the view of the developers,” Rees said at the meeting. ‘Sewer Overload’ Goldman Sachs bought an adjoining site at Plumtree Court in February, according to documents filed with the U.K.’s Land Registry. An application is expected for a “comprehensive redevelopment” of the sites, the City of London said in the documents provided to the borough’s council. Goldman Sachs will have to show how it plans to “reduce the risk of sewer overload in this area” during development, the City of London told the New York-based bank’s planning adviser DP9 Ltd. in an Aug. 30 letter. The area is a “flood risk hotspot,” according to the letter. Vibrations during construction may also lead “to water main bursts and or sewer collapses,” the City wrote. The borough released the letter following a request by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs’s London Property unit had assets of 73.7 million pounds ($120 million) through December and paid 103.4 million pounds for a development site this year, according to a filing with Companies House in August. Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau, bought River Court, part of Goldman Sachs existing European headquarters, from a group of Irish investors advised by Warren Private Clients Ltd. for about 280 million pounds last year.

{"headline": "PBOC Researcher Calls on U.S. to Sell Gold Reserves, People's Daily Says", "article": "The U.S. should cut its government spending and sell some gold reserves to balance its budget and fund its recovery, the People’s Daily overseas edition reported, citing Xia Bin, an adviser to the People’s Bank of China. The U.S. has to resolve its “twin deficits” in the government budget and the current account, Xia was quoted as saying. Three ways that may help the U.S. achieve that target include reducing military expenses, selling part of its gold reserves and relaxing some export limits on technology, he said. “The U.S. has more than 8,000 tons of gold reserves; why can’t it sell some of it since the country wants to raise funds for economic recovery but doesn’t want to add more burden to the fiscal deficit,” Xia told the newspaper. He didn’t mention whether China would be willing to purchase any gold from the U.S. China ranks as the world’s largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with $883.5 billion as of Sept. 30, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. China should raise its gold holdings and its 1,054 tons of reserves are inadequate compared with the 8,133 tons held by the U.S. and 3,408 tons by Germany, Meng Qingfa, a researcher at the China Chamber of International Commerce said on Oct. 27. The U.S. won’t be able to get to the bottom of the problem if the government keeps relying on printing money, Xia said. “The financial market in the U.S. is not short of liquidity, and the money can’t get into the real economy,” he said. Expanding money supply may not be the answer in the U.S. as the high unemployment there is a structural, instead of a liquidity, issue, Xia said. The Federal Reserve said Nov. 3 it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June. Policy makers, setting a pace of about $75 billion of purchases a month, “will adjust the program as needed,” the Fed’s Open Market Committee said in a statement in Washington. -- Feiwen Rong.

All nations except the U.S. and Israel are invited, he told reporters in Tehran on July 23. Iran hasn’t had diplomatic ties with the U.S. for more than three decades, and doesn’t recognize Israel. Previous events were attended by ambassadors, according to state-run Press TV. The Aug. 4 ceremony will take place a day after Rohani’s endorsement by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country. Rohani, who campaigned for more moderation in Iran’s domestic and foreign policies, was elected June 14 to succeed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Araghchi did not say why this inauguration will be different. The move may serve to illustrate Rohani’s pledge to better engage with the world after eight years under Ahmadinejad in which the Islamic republic became increasingly isolated politically and economically. Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Lebanese President Michel Suleiman are planning to attend the event, Press TV reported. Syria’s Prime Minister Wael al-Halaqi, Iraqi Vice-President Khudair al-Khuzaie, and top officials from Kuwait , Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar will also come, it said.

{"headline": "JPMorgan Executive Dunleavy Named in FERC Complaint Retires", "article": "Francis Dunleavy, the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) energy executive who ran the Houston unit that developed trading strategies deemed illegal by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has retired. The move, ending a career spanning more than three decades, took effect last month, Brian Marchiony , a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said today. Dunleavy, as head of JPMorgan’s principal investments unit, oversaw bidding strategies that the FERC said manipulated power markets. JPMorgan agreed in July to pay $410 million and forgo collecting on $262 million in disputed payments from California’s grid operator to settle the charges. Dunleavy was a Bear Stearns Cos. veteran, joining that firm in 1982 and becoming one of its senior energy executives, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets , acquired Bear Stearns in 2008. Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, who both reported to Dunleavy, still work for the bank, Marchiony said. While the FERC didn’t sanction individuals in the case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a separate probe to see if anyone committed crimes, a person briefed on the matter said in August. Dunleavy resigned from JPMorgan warehouse operator Henry Bath & Son Ltd., effective Oct. 25, according to a filing earlier this week. William Scherman, an attorney for Dunleavy at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP in Washington , said his client wasn’t available to comment.

{"headline": "Yellen Says, Yes, the Fed Makes the Rich Richer ", "article": "During this morning's hearing, quite a few members of the Senate Banking Committee asked Janet Yellen, the president’s nominee to run the Federal Reserve, whether the Fed was benefiting certain segments of society more than others. Unsurprisingly, Yellen’s response was similar to what current Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said when he was asked the same sorts of questions in July : The Fed is trying to help all Americans. Even so, Yellen's answers reveal that the central bank’s policies are producing relative winners and losers. Early on, Yellen explained that the purpose of the Fed's policies “is to bring down interest rates to promote spending in interest-sensitive sectors.” That’s helped autos and housing relatively more than the rest of the economy. It also makes one wonder to what extent the Fed was responsible for some of the run-up in house prices during the go-go years, given its extraordinary efforts (at the time) to suppress interest rates. Toward the middle of the hearing, Yellen said the Fed’s asset purchases and commitment to keep short-term interest rates low boosts share prices, but also noted that many Americans benefited from falling mortgage interest rates and the parallel increases in house prices. But the biggest direct beneficiaries of lower mortgage rates were the well-to-do , who were best positioned to refinance. Although it’s certainly good that many borrowers have been lifted above water on their mortgages thanks to rising house prices, there are good reasons to be skeptical that this will generate much additional spending. The tens of millions of Americans who own neither shares nor their own homes may have benefited indirectly as relatively wealthy people got even wealthier, but that’s not much different than saying lower taxes on the rich improve the well-being of the poor. The increase in asset prices and collapse in real yields have also meant that workers have to save a larger chunk of their incomes to get the same quality of life in retirement. When confronted with concerns about people struggling to live off fixed incomes, Yellen agreed that “low interest rates harm savers, it’s absolutely true.” Harming at least some savers, however, may be part of the plan, at least if Yellen agrees with Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He has argued that the threat of wealth confiscation by negative interest rates is necessary to restore spending and “risk-taking” back to “normal levels.” To be fair, the wealthy probably hold far more safe assets than they really need. But Bankrate, a consumer financial services company, has found that less than one-quarter of Americans have enough cash on hand to cover just six months of expenses in the event of an emergency. Imposing negative rates on them in an attempt to boost consumer spending reminds me of the old saying that the beatings will continue until morale improves. These admissions suggest the Fed’s leaders believe that the central bank boosts the economy chiefly by enriching certain people in the hope that they go out and spend their newfound wealth. The strategy is probably better than doing nothing, but it’s understandable why so many senators are troubled by the distributional impacts of Fed policy. Congress could get around these unsavory side effects by enacting broad-based tax cuts or by having the Treasury send checks directly to every American. Unfortunately neither of those ideas seems to be on the agenda right now. (Matthew C. Klein is a writer for Bloomberg View.

{"headline": "New York to Pursue Ernst & Young Lawsuit", "article": "Ernst & Young LLP, bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) ’s former auditor, should “disgorge” $125 million in fees earned in an alleged fraud involving so- called Repo 105 transactions that concealed tens of billions of dollars in debt, the New York attorney general said. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked a judge today to let him pursue the suit after the auditing firm tried to get it dismissed. The state is limited by law from recovering the fees for itself or for Lehman’s former shareholders, Ernst & Young said. “E&Y is wrong on every count,” Schneiderman said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. “It is well- settled that the state can, and frequently does, obtain disgorgement of ill-gotten gains under public enforcement statutes.” Repo 105 transactions are a form of short-term financing that Lehman used to move as much as $50 billion off its balance sheet temporarily to show investors it wasn’t carrying too much debt, according to a bankruptcy examiner’s report. The report was used as a basis for many suits, including one that Ernst & Young is fighting by investors including the Alameda County Employees’ Retirement Association, which alleges the firm made misleading statements about Lehman’s finances before its 2008 bankruptcy. Standards, Rules Charlie Perkins, an Ernst & Young spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to a call and e-mail after regular business hours seeking comment on the attorney general’s filing. The auditing firm has said its work for Lehman met all applicable professional standards and applied rules that existed at the time. Schneiderman said New York wasn’t suing on behalf of Lehman’s shareholders and could distribute money obtained from the suit “in any manner that serves justice, including to the state.” Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in history in September 2008 with $639 billion in assets. It has said it will spend the next few years completing a liquidation to pay unsecured creditors less than 18 cents on the dollar. The case is People of the State of New York v.

{"headline": "Mogadishu Fighting Kills Six as Government Battles Islamists", "article": "At least six people were killed and two dozen others wounded in the Somali capital Mogadishu as government forces backed by African Union troops battled Islamist insurgents. The battle began early today when the government forces with the African Union Mission in Somalia attacked Al-shabaab entrenchments in the Wardigley and Howlwadag districts and the Sayid junction near the presidential palace. “Our troops are advancing towards their strong positions” Abdullahi Ali Anod, a commander for presidential forces, told journalists today. “We have lost one soldier, and six others have sustained injuries. We have launched a planned attack towards their positions this morning.” Both sides exchanged fire from artillery, mortar and rocket-propelled grenades. Residents and witnesses said the fighting is continuing. “The causalities are not confirmed exactly because the stray bullets and mortars have hit several people in different locations,” Ali Muse Sheikh, director of Mogadishu ambulances services, said in an interview today. “Until now, six civilian corpses have been collected and 16 others wounded.” Witnesses and residents said that heavily armed Al-shabaab troops have joined the battle. The fighting has resumed again this afternoon as civilians were wounded or killed by stray mortars from areas that are far from the battle including Bakara market, HamarJajab and Hamarweyne district. “Five Christians from Ugandan troops and seven apostate soldiers (a reference to government soldiers) have been killed in the battle, and their corpses are still in the street,” Sheikh Abdul Aziz Abu Musab, an army spokesman for Al-shabaab, said on a conference call with reporters today. “They have failed in their attack.” To contact the reporter on this story: To contact the editor responsible for this story: Antony Sguazzin at  asguazzin@bloomberg.net -0- Feb/19/ :31 GMT", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "소말리아의 정치적 불안정이 해당 국가에 투자한 국제 기업의 리스크에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "아프리카 연합군의 군사 개입이 소말리아의 경제와 금융 시장에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "소말리아의 지속적인 정치적 불안정이 글로벌 금융 시장에 어떤 간접적인 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "Swaziland to Slash Spending, State Jobs in Budget, Finance Minister Says", "article": "Swaziland, Africa ’s last absolute monarchy, will slash spending and fire thousands of state employees as it tries to ease a fiscal crisis, Finance Minister Majozi Sithole said. In a budget to be announced on Feb. 18, the government will introduce a value added tax and slash recurrent spending, such as salaries, by about 20 percent, Sithole said in an interview yesterday in Mbabane, the southern African nation’s capital. It will also cut support for state-owned companies by 10 percent in the fiscal year through March 2012. Budget cuts “have to be very large,” Sithole said. “For us credibility is very important. We would not want to have a budget, but not have the physical cash to support it.” Swaziland, which borders South Africa and whose 1.2 million people are ruled by King Mswati III, released an International Monetary Fund-backed plan last year to counter reduced income from the Southern Africa Customs Union. Lower imports because of recession in neighboring South Africa during the global financial crisis cut funding from what accounted for about 60 percent of state revenue. SACU pools customs payments from South Africa, Lesotho , Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland. Swaziland’s budget deficit will probably widen to about 16 percent of gross domestic product in the 2011-12 fiscal year, the IMF said on Jan. 24. Customs union money tumbled about 62 percent last year, Sithole said. “For the financial year 2010-11 we were seriously affected by our SACU receipts,” Sithole said. “We have over the years relied heavily on the revenue received from SACU.” Salary Freeze The government plans to freeze state salaries and cut 7,000 civil servant jobs, about 20 percent of the total, to bring down a “huge” wage bill, he said. Budget spending was 10.1 billion emalengeni ($1.39 billion) for the year to March 2011. The move will add to unemployment which stands at about 43 percent, according to the government. The government plans to raise taxes and has applied for a $100 million loan from the African Development Bank as it struggles to raise cash. The central bank sold one-fifth of the 750 million emalengeni ($103 million) of seven-year bonds it offered on Jan. 26. The AfDB loan depends on an endorsement from the IMF of the country’s plans to cut spending, Sithole said. IMF officials will visit the country this week., he said Economic growth will probably be unchanged at 2 percent this year, while inflation is estimated to accelerate to 6 percent in 2011 from last year’s 4.5 percent as oil prices and other imports costs rise, Sithole said.

{"headline": "Google Mulling Who Testifies Before Senate", "article": "Google Inc. (GOOG) is still deliberating over which executive to send to a U.S. Senate panel probing its market power, Chairman Eric Schmidt said. “We have not made a decision yet,” Schmidt said yesterday at a media-industry conference in Sun Valley , Idaho. “It’s a legal question of who is best to represent the company. We’ll make a decision soon.” The antitrust subcommittee has asked Google to provide a top executive who could deliver testimony, and has threatened to issue subpoenas to compel Schmidt or Chief Executive Officer Larry Page to attend. The Senate probe reflects a groundswell of scrutiny of Google’s competitive position. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is probing the business, as is the European Union. Separately, the antitrust division of the Department of Justice is reviewing Google’s $400 million purchase of the Internet-advertising company Admeld Inc. In a letter dated June 10, the Democratic chairman and leading Republican on the Senate antitrust subcommittee asked Google to provide one of the company’s two senior executives before Congress’s August recess. The letter urged an agreement, to avoid “more formal procedures,” according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg News. Beyond ‘Legal Issues’ Google offered to have Chief Legal Officer David Drummond appear at the hearing, according to the letter. The subcommittee would “strongly prefer” Page or Schmidt at the proceeding, “which will address fundamental questions of business operations rather than merely legal issues,” according to the letter. The FTC is preparing for its probe by asking technology companies to gather information about Google, three people familiar with the matter said in April. In his remarks yesterday, Schmidt referred to previous FTC investigations, which include the review of its AdMob acquisition and probes into the privacy implications of its Street View and Google Buzz products. “They know us pretty well,” Schmidt said. Google’s chairman recently met with European Union officials during a trip to Brussels, he said yesterday. That body is still reviewing Google’s answers to a round of questioning, Schmidt said. European investigators have contacted 800 companies, he said. Schmidt said he doesn’t know how long the Justice Department ’s review of its Admeld acquisition could take. Twitter, Hulu He also discussed other topics, such as a failed agreement with Twitter Inc. and Google’s new social-networking site Google+. Google couldn’t reach a search accord with Twitter after “lengthy” talks, Schmidt said. Google+, meanwhile, has struggled with a flood of users. Millions of invited users were blocked by the service, he said. Schmidt declined to comment on whether Google is interested in buying Hulu LLC, the video-streaming service. Bankers for Hulu have met with Google, Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as the company explores a sale, people familiar with the process said last week. “We are not able to answer M&A questions,” Schmidt said. “But it’s widely reported that Hulu is being discussed.” He said acquiring a premium-content service like Hulu “is not the highest priority” for Google now because its own YouTube video site is doing well with revenue generation and developing original content. Hulu’s owners include Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , News Corp. and Comcast Corp.’s NBC Universal. Disney CEO Robert Iger said this week that Hulu’s owners are “committed to selling.” Google fell $18.19, or 3.3 percent, to $528.41 at 11:28 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

Xstrata is sounding out other shareholders’ views on the performance of Lonmin management and its planned stock sale while considering a revised offer, two people familiar with the matter said yesterday. Lonmin has already rejected a proposal to buy Xstrata’s South African platinum and alloys businesses. The plan called for Lonmin to hold a $1 billion share sale that would be fully underwritten by Xstrata, increasing the Zug, Switzerland-based company’s stake to 70 percent from 25 percent in a reverse takeover. Lonmin also spurned a second offer from Xstrata to support its rights issue, which is necessary to meet pledges to creditors, on the condition that senior management are replaced. Xstrata said last week it was concerned about management and “longstanding operational problems” at Lonmin. “We think Lonmin is fearful that Xstrata’s previous proposals have merit and shareholders may approve a separate offer under similar terms,” Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London , said in a note. Lonmin needs to raise at least $700 million from the share sale by Dec. 31 after negotiating a deal with creditors amid plans to restructure its balance sheet, the company said. Shareholders are due to vote on the rights issue on Nov. 19. “If the rights issue does not proceed by 31 December 2012 and the amended facilities agreements do not come into effect, the company may be unable to comply with its financial covenants in future tests which may ultimately jeopardize its very future,” Lonmin said.

{"headline": "Royal Mail Misses Regulator’s First-Class Mail Targets", "article": "Royal Mail Plc (RMG) , the U.K.’s 360-year-old postal company, missed service-quality targets set by regulators to ensure regular mail deliveries. The company delivered 91.7 percent of First Class letters the day after collection in the year through March, compared with a 93 percent target, the U.K.’s communications competition authority Ofcom said in a statement today. The postal service also failed to make next-day deliveries to many parts of the U.K., completing this service in only 62 percent of postcodes, below the 91.5 percent required, Ofcom said. “Should it miss the targets in future, Ofcom will consider opening a formal investigation which could result in enforcement action, including the possibility of fines,” the regulator said. Royal Mail raised 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) in an initial public offering last month, a move that was opposed by many union members and opposition politicians. “We were disappointed that we didn’t meet all of the regulatory quality of service targets we were required to last year,” a Royal Mail spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. “This remains a key area of focus for us.” About 86 percent of residential customers are generally satisfied with the postal service, Ofcom said.

{"headline": "U.S. Doctors Shouldn’t Have to Beg for TB Drugs", "article": "I am a tuberculosis doctor. My patients and I inhabit a world of TB medications, diagnostic technology and public-health investigations. Together we have celebrated many triumphs over this deadly, but curable, disease. The problem we are now facing, however, is so threatening that it will take a concerted national effort to prevail. I am talking about the shortage of tuberculosis drugs. Last December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that U.S. supplies of isoniazid, the most important drug in the treatment of TB, were critically low. A national survey of health departments in January reported that 79 percent of responding jurisdictions were having trouble getting the drug. In California , where tuberculosis cases are the highest in the nation, we have struggled to keep the drug available. Physicians are now being advised by the CDC to ration their isoniazid supplies. As the TB controller for my county’s public-health department, I have to choose which patients get their potentially life-saving medications, and which ones don’t. Alternative regimens without isoniazid exist, but they can be more toxic, longer in duration and more expensive. Isoniazid is just the latest -- albeit the most essential - - drug to be added to the growing list of unavailable or critically low TB medications in the U.S. Many of the other drugs we have relied on -- including kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin -- have been difficult to obtain for more than a year. California First California is ground zero for TB in the U.S. With 2.3 million Californians infected with M. tuberculosis, we have the most TB disease, the most TB deaths and the greatest number of the most feared form: multidrug-resistant TB. We aren’t exactly chanting “We’re No. 1.” In this emerging era of drug shortages, we are becoming desperate. How desperate are we? Desperate enough to turn for help to the Global Drug Facility, a part of the World Health Organization that ensures universal access to TB drugs for even the most impoverished countries. Kenya , India , the Philippines and Uganda (to name only a few) all rely on the facility for an uninterrupted supply of vital TB medications. The Global Drug Facility is funded partly by the U.S. I sat beside many other TB doctors from around the U.S. when we met with a GDF representative recently, and we all agreed: Asking the GDF for emergency help had to be considered. And last week, in an article about the nationwide isoniazid shortage in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agreed. How is it that the wealthiest country on Earth could be forced to resort to a Third World solution to treat a disease as dangerous as TB? To make things worse, we have received reports from pharmacies that isoniazid prices may skyrocket soon. Currently, a 30-pill batch of 100-milligram tablets costs $35.51. The notices, linked to one of the three isoniazid manufacturers, informed pharmacies that the price would rise to $1,309.94. That is a whopping 3,589 percent increase. (It hasn’t happened yet, possibly due to vocal protests -- and the promise of industry shaming -- by TB doctors.) Price-gouging isn’t unprecedented in the pharmaceutical industry. In October 2011, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13588 in response to such behavior. The order states that “some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices.” The order directs the Food and Drug Administration to notify the Justice Department of any suspicious pricing. I think anyone would agree that a 3,589 percent increase qualifies as “exorbitant.” Unfortunately, the FDA directly contradicts Order 13588 by stating on its website, “Pricing issues are not within the purview of the FDA.” Moving Backward This shortage will have dire health consequences for the U.S. We are going to see marked increases in TB across the nation -- a tragic step backward for public health. The three U.S suppliers of isoniazid are Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Sandoz Inc. and VersaPharm Inc. Teva and Sandoz blame the problem on shortages of the drug’s active ingredient and on shipment delays. VersaPharm recently notified public-health officials that it is canceling all orders for isoniazid because tests have shown that the purity of its product falls outside FDA specifications. (The company is working to correct this by 2014.) Because no federal law mandates that pharmaceutical companies produce sufficient amounts of essential medications, public health is at the mercy of pharmaceutical executives’ decisions. This is a broken system. So what is the solution? First, the FDA and CDC should construct a list of essential public-health medications, such as those that treat TB. No such list exists. Next, President Obama should issue an executive order requiring that pharmaceutical manufacturers report any anticipated shortage of medications on the list six months in advance. Such an order, had it been in place, could have prevented much of our recent scrambling. TB doctors have been reduced to begging drugmakers not to push up their prices; asking pharmacies to send a few more isoniazid pills; and now pleading with the World Health Organization for aid from the Global Drug Facility. When it comes to treating a disease as contagious and deadly as tuberculosis, we can’t succeed as beggars. We must have a more reliable system for delivering the medicines our patients need.

{"headline": "RIM Averts Shareholder Showdown in Agreement to Study Chairman Role Change", "article": "Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , facing a shareholder vote on whether to split its chief executive and chairman roles, agreed to study the overhaul of its management structure to avoid a public showdown at its investors’ meeting this month. Northwest & Ethical Investments LP had proposed a split in the chairman and chief executive officer roles at the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, where Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis are both co-CEOs and co-chairmen. Investors were scheduled to vote on the measure at RIM’s shareholder meeting on July 12. Instead, RIM reached an agreement with NEI to withdraw the proposal so no vote will take place. The company will establish a committee of independent directors to study its board structure, the merits of a lead director versus a chair and the “business necessity” for the company’s co-CEOs to hold “significant” board-level titles, RIM said yesterday in a statement. “At this point, they want to acknowledge there’s an issue that they want to look at and can’t ignore,” said Alkesh Shah, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) in New York. “If they hadn’t said they would at least consider this split, they would have had a bigger problem.” RIM has come under pressure to shake up management as the BlackBerry smartphone maker loses market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and handset makers that use Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system. RIM said on June 16 that quarterly revenue may decline for the first time in nine years, sending its stock down 21 percent the next day. The shares have lost half their value this year before today. Proxy Firm Support NEI’s proposal had won support from Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., proxy firms that advise shareholders how to vote on such measures. The committee of directors will also “propose and provide a rationale for a recommended governance structure” that will include clarification of the CEO and chairman roles, RIM said yesterday in the statement. The committee will issue a report on the matter by Jan. 31, 2012. “RIM and NEI Investments are pleased to have reached an agreement on this matter,” the company said in the statement. Robert Walker , vice president, ethical funds at Northwest & Ethical, who led the shareholder proposal, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. Walker said in a June 24 interview that RIM’s shareholders are increasingly in favor of management change and the resolution would likely get the support to pass. ’Perfect Storm’ “It is a bit of a perfect storm in terms of long-term shareholder coalition around the concept that chairman and co- CEO should be separated,” he said at the time. Charlie Wolf , an analyst with Needham & Co., said the proposal may have been withdrawn because it wasn’t likely to pass. “It was a silly proposal,” said Wolf, who is based in New York and has a “hold” rating on the stock. “It was obviously withdrawn because it had no chance of passing.” RIM responded separately yesterday to what may have been an open letter posted on the Internet by an employee, saying that the company takes the operational challenges it faces ‘seriously’ by taking steps including cutting staff. “Regardless of whether the letter is real, fake, exaggerated or written with ulterior motivations, it is fair to say the senior management team at RIM is nonetheless fully aware of and aggressively addressing both the company’s challenges and its opportunities,” the company said on its BlackBerry blog.

{"headline": "Gross Says Germany in Bond Bubble as Liabilities Increase", "article": "Bill Gross , who runs the world’s largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said Germany is in a bond market bubble as the country is saddled with rising liabilities from Europe’s debt crisis. “I would be leery of German bunds simply because there are only a few scenarios in which they can do well,” Gross said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. “Germany for me is a credit risk. It’s not an attractive market.” Germany is the largest contributor to Europe’s bailout packages for Greece and a collapse of that nation’s economy and its possible exit from the euro area may weigh heavily on Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s administration. While German bonds have profited from Europe’s crisis, pushing yields on two-year notes below zero this month for the first time, Gross said the bonds have little room to rise further, except in a scenario such as Germany leaving the euro. German 10-year yields have advanced from a record low of 1.127 percent reached June 1 as Europe’s deepening crisis fueled concern the currency bloc’s biggest economy will be left picking up a mounting tab. The yield today closed at 1.44 percent. ‘Cleanest Shirts’ The difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and comparable German bunds was at 17.35 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap was as high as 49 basis points on April 4. The gap has narrowed as investors have favored securities from outside the euro area amid the debt crisis. Gross, Pimco’s founder and co-chief investment officer, said the U.S. and U.K. are the “cleanest dirty shirts” for bond investors. Pimco is avoiding Spanish bonds because there’s a high probability that they won’t return investors’ money at par, he said. “It’s not a safe environment as long as the EU and as long as the global economy is delevering, which it continues to do,” said Gross.

{"headline": "Audit Faults Stimulus-Backed $1.5 Billion U.S. Clean-Coal Effort", "article": "Poor management has hampered a U.S. program to develop technology to capture carbon-dioxide emissions, the Energy Department inspector general said in a report that raises new questions about a clean-energy initiative backed by the 2009 economic stimulus. In total, the Energy Department received $1.5 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to invest in technology that responds to climate-change risks. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that most scientists think is making the planet hotter. Energy officials hadn’t “adequately documented the approval and rationale” in awarding $575 million to 15 recipients, the watchdog found. Three projects won $90 million even though a review process identified significant financial and technical issues with the companies that won the aid, according to the report. “The issues we identified occurred, in part, because program officials had not always provided effective monitoring and oversight of recipient activities,” the inspector general found. In response, the Energy Department said it would improve program oversight. “Project monitoring procedures will be reviewed to ensure sound guidance exists for conducting consistent, thorough reviews of documentation supporting invoiced costs,” Chuck McConnell, assistant secretary for fossil energy, wrote in response to the report. Clean Energy The stimulus provided a record $90 billion for clean-energy programs, about $35 billion of which went to the Energy Department to distribute. The money paid for a $535 million loan guarantee in 2009 to Solyndra LLC, a solar-panel maker that went bankrupt two years later. Republicans have criticized management of the program and what they say are the administration’s efforts to pick winners and losers among energy companies. As of February, the department has spent about $623 million, or less than 42 percent, of the money for the cleaner- coal program, according to the report. That leaves about $860 million left to be spent. The watchdog report covered $1.1 billion directed to 15 projects. Energy Department officials faced a Sept. 30, 2010, deadline to distribute the stimulus money, which was designed to kick-start an economy in a deep recession following the financial crisis of 2008. ‘Unprecedented’ Investment The program “represented an investment in the development of clean-coal technologies that was unprecedented in terms of cost and scope,” according to the report. The report found that the department reimbursed recipients about $18.3 million in questionable expenses. The department said in response that it was seeking to reclaim the money. The agency spent $90 million on three projects the review suggested faced technical challenges or were unable to raise the required amount of private capital to win the government money. The projects have experienced delays, the inspector general said. The department had only distributed about $7 million of the funds. The department sometimes changed the terms of the awards, in one instance reducing the amount the recipient was to put up to $11.6 million from $92.6 million. That $25 million project was supposed to create 272 jobs. As of July 2012, only 68 had been created, according to the report. While federal officials were supposed to award contracts through competitive bidding, the report found that $575 million went to accelerate existing projects without always documenting its rationale for doing so. The Energy Department told the watchdog that it didn’t receive the number of bids it had anticipated, so it decided to direct some money to existing programs in order to use the stimulus money by the deadline.

{"headline": "HSBC to Wind Down South Korea Retail Bank Amid Global Revamp", "article": "HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) plans to wind down its retail banking and wealth management business in South Korea as it seeks to revive profitability. Europe ’s biggest lender plans to close 10 of its 11 branches in Korea pending regulatory approval, according to a statement from the London-based bank today. HSBC “remains committed” to Korea, where it will focus on its global banking and markets business, it said. Plans by the U.K. lender to withdraw from retail banking in Korea suffered a blow when KDB Financial Group Inc. last year abandoned talks to take over the operation. HSBC Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has closed or sold at least 52 businesses since he took the job in 2011, including retail operations in 17 markets, according to the statement. Consumer banking in South Korea has been constrained by rising household debt that’s also burdening the economy. Borrowing and credit purchases by Koreans swelled to a record 963.8 trillion won ($844 billion) at the end of 2012, central bank data show. President Park Geun Hye, who took office in February, set up a fund that is aimed at easing households’ debt loads by purchasing and rescheduling overdue loans. South Korean regulators are reviewing HSBC’s application, according to an e-mailed joint statement from the Financial Services Commission and Financial Supervisory Service. Shares of HSBC rose 0.7 percent in London to 716 pence at 9:24 a.m., outperforming the 0.3 percent gain in the benchmark FTSE 100 Index and taking their gain this year to 11 percent. Three Attempts HSBC has failed in at least three attempts to build up its Korean retail business since it began operations in 1998. In 1999, the U.K. lender walked away from talks with the Korean government to buy SeoulBank. In 2005, it lost a bid for Korea First Bank to Standard Chartered Plc. HSBC also abandoned a $6 billion bid to acquire Korea Exchange Bank in 2008 after authorities left the transaction in limbo for more than a year. HSBC in April sold the stake it bought in 2007 in South Korea’s Hana HSBC Life Insurance Co. back to Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  The bank plans to keep a branch in the country to serve existing retail clients and its global banking and markets business, according to the statement. HSBC, whose history in Korea dates back to 1897, had 25 trillion won of assets in the country as of the end of 2011, according to its website. KDB, South Korea’s largest state-owned banking group, said last year that talks on buying HSBC’s local retail business broke down because of conditions related to employment. KDB in April 2012 had agreed to buy the lender’s assets and debt at 11 South Korean branches.

{"headline": "Pound Falls as U.K. Home Sellers Cut Asking Prices in December", "article": "The pound weakened against the dollar as a report showed U.K. home sellers cut asking prices for a second consecutive month, adding to signs the economy is losing momentum. Sterling snapped two days of gains versus its U.S. counterpart as Rightmove Plc said prices in England and Wales fell 2.7 percent from November, and added that the property market will remain “challenging” in 2012. The pound fell against the euro even after France had its credit outlook lowered by Fitch Ratings , on speculation the U.K. economy will suffer as the euro-region debt crisis escalates. “Consumers who have found their incomes squeezed are also wary about the future, so in that context the background for sterling is relatively challenging,” said Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. Still “the resilience of the U.K. versus the euro still looks attractive.” The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5523 at 4:45 p.m. London time, adding to last week’s 0.8 percent decline. It was little changed at 83.85 pence per euro, after climbing last week to 83.73, its strongest level since Feb. 18. U.K. government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year gilt yield two basis points higher to 2.07 percent, trimming declines this year that pushed it to a record low 2.034 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 fell 0.225, or 2.25 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 114.745. Gilt Returns Gilts have returned 16 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds earned 9.5 percent, and U.S. Treasuries climbed 10 percent. Investors bought British bonds as an alternative to assets denominated in the euro as European Union leaders struggled to solve a debt crisis that has forced Greece , Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts. The turmoil also engulfed Italy and Spain and prompted the bloc to create funds to help stricken economies. French 10-year yields rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.10 percent, leaving the extra yield, or spread, investors get for holding the securities instead of similar-maturity gilts at 103 basis points. The French debt yielded 22 basis points less than gilts in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sterling strengthened 0.1 percent today against nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar was little changed and the euro lost 0.1 percent. Britain’s currency may slip to its October low against the dollar should it fall below $1.5400, Michael Hewson , a markets analyst at CMC Markets Ltd. in London, wrote in a client note today. Sterling slipped to $1.5272, the lowest since July 23, 2010. The pound weakened against the dollar last week as reports showed unemployment surged and retail sales fell more than economists forecast in November, strengthening the case for the Bank of England to add to its asset-purchase program.

{"headline": "Hungary Seeks Seat Among UN Powerful for Unsung Role in Libya", "article": "In Libya , as a revolt against Muammar Qaddafi’s four-decade regime turned dangerous, Hungarian diplomats did what most others didn’t do: They stuck around. “When everyone left, we still stayed,” Csaba Korosi, Hungary ’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview. “We tried to be a bridge builder, even between the two sides.” Long after the U.S., U.K. and France shut down their embassies, evacuated their staffs and rushed to get their citizens out of Libya, Hungary kept a presence in the capital Tripoli. It became the diplomat of last resort for some 50 absent governments throughout the seven-month conflict. Among its successes was securing the release of four foreign journalists: two Americans, one Spanish and one British. In August, the Hungarian embassy even managed to get Talitha van Zon, a former Dutch model and one-time girlfriend of Qaddafi’s son Mutassim, out of the country after she jumped from the balcony of a Tripoli hotel trying to escape. Humgary’s reward for such steadfastness could be a seat on the 15-member Security Council, the UN’s most powerful body. UN members are scheduled to vote Oct. 21 for five new council members, who will serve two-year terms beginning Jan. 1. The tightest race will be for the Eastern European seat, sought also by Azerbaijan and Slovenia, to replace the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hungary, an imperial power before World War I and a Soviet satellite until the late 1980s, had no vested interest in the North African country, Korosi said. Yet, when the Libyan uprisings began in February, Hungary, then-head of the rotating European Union presidency, felt duty-bound not to leave. Others Fled As the channel of communications, Hungary provided a way “to rescue a lot of people and civilians from the country,” Korosi said in an Oct. 14 interview. “We tried to speak on behalf of all those countries that asked us to do so. We sent messages back and forth.” The U.S. shut down its embassy on Feb. 25, as President Barack Obama prepared to sign an order to freeze assets of Qaddafi, his family and collaborators in the first of a series of sanctions. A day later, France and Britain closed their missions. Germany, Italy and Spain and others followed within weeks. Turkey, which conducted the biggest evacuation in its history to rescue 25,000 Turks who lived and worked in Libya, cited “great security risk” as the reason to shut its embassy in May. Skeleton Staff That left Hungary to hold the fort with a skeleton staff. Among the other countries that kept embassies operational were China and Russia -- among the fiercest critics of NATO’s military strikes in Libya -- and a handful of Qaddafi’s most stalwart, radical allies such as Belarus, Cuba and Venezuela. Maja Kociancic, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , said in May that the “situation is definitely very difficult and we pay tribute to the Hungarian presidency for the work they are doing.” Hungary is weighing closer economic integration with Europe , where formerly Communist neighbors such as Slovenia, its biggest rival for the council seat, have joined the nations using the euro. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban , whose government took over in May, has set a new deadline to switch to the euro: 2020. Europe hasn’t reached “the bottom of the economic crisis,” said Korosi. “It will test the durability of many countries. Some fragile societies may suffer more than in the past years.” UN Rivals Azerbaijan , geographically the largest country in the Caucasus region, is seeking a seat in the council for the first time and is the only Muslim applicant for the Eastern European seat. It has the second highest concentration of Shiite Muslims after Iran. Slovenia, which like Bosnia was formerly part of Yugoslavia, was the first to secede from the communist state following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the only one to meet the economic criteria to qualify for the euro. As one of smallest and newest euro members, cradled between Italy and Hungary, Slovenia joined the 17-nation bloc in 2007 before Greece ’s financial debt plunged the region into a debt crisis that threatens the existence of the single currency. “We believe it’s going to be a tight race,” said Korosi of his competition. “There are two very good friends of ours. One is a neighbor.” The countries that fled Tripoli have since returned after rebel forces wrested control of the capital from Qaddafi loyalists. Libya’s ambassador to the UN praised the Hungarians’ actions during the conflict. “I think they have played a positive role,” said Ibrahim Dabbashi , who became Libya’s ambassador after defecting from the Qaddafi regime in February. Their actions have already met with some recognition on the ground. The road next to the Hungarian embassy was renamed by locals Hungarian Street. -- Editor: Terry Atlas To contact the reporters on this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson in United Nations at  fjackson@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Silva at  msilva34@bloomberg.net ;", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "헝가리가 리비아에서 다른 국가들과 달리 대사관을 유지한 이유는 무엇인가요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "헝가리가 리비아에서 대사관을 유지함으로써 어떤 외교적 성과를 거두었나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "헝가리가 리비아에서 대사관을 유지한 것이 UN 안전보장이사회 진출에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "European Stocks Drop for Third Day; Clariant, Merck Lead Decline", "article": "European stocks fell for a third day as earnings from Clariant AG (CLN) to Merck KGaA (MRK) missed estimates and U.S. politicians wrangled over the nation’s debt limit. Clariant, a Swiss chemical maker, plunged the most in eight years. Merck, Germany’s second-biggest drugmaker, dropped 4.8 percent as it reported an unexpected loss. PSA Peugeot Citroen tumbled 7.6 percent after saying its automotive division may post a second-half loss. Banco Santander SA (SAN) led financial shares lower after Spain ’s biggest bank said profit declined as Spanish loan provisions surged. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 1.1 percent to 267.05 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has retreated 8.3 percent from this year’s high in February amid concern that Europe’s fiscal crisis will derail the economic recovery and speculation that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on increasing the nation’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline. “The earnings season has revealed that weakness in the global economy remains,” Philippe Gijsels , the head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said in a phone interview from Brussels. “There have been some misses in terms of guidance and this shows us we’re in a mid-cycle slowdown with companies being held hostage by economic conditions.” U.S. Rating Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have said they may cut the U.S.’s top-level sovereign rating if officials fail to resolve the stalemate on the $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling. The government needs to boost the cap by Aug. 2 so it can keep paying its bills, according to the Treasury Department. “The likelihood of a U.S. sovereign-rating downgrade is around 50 percent,” Andrew Garthwaite , the London-based head of global equity strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a report to clients today. “If there is no increase in the debt ceiling for a prolonged period -- say 3 months -- with no agreement in sight, we believe stock markets could easily fall 15 percent.” He predicted that an agreement will be made to raise the debt limit before next week’s deadline passes. Profit has missed analyst estimates by an average of 3.3 percent for companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported results since July 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average beat of 7.5 percent for members of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the same period. Durable Goods Stocks extended losses after a report in the U.S. showed orders for durable goods unexpectedly dropped in June and inventories climbed at the slowest pace in a year, evidence that companies lost confidence in the strength of the recovery as the second quarter ended. Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years fell 2.1 percent after a 1.9 percent gain the prior month that was smaller than last reported, the Commerce Department said. National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 1.2 percent, Germany ’s DAX lost 1.3 percent and France ’s CAC declined 1.4 percent. Clariant plunged 14 percent to 13.19 Swiss francs, the largest drop since February 2003. Second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined to 241 million francs ($301 million) from 264 million francs, the Muttenz, Switzerland-based company said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts had predicted 293 million francs. Merck unexpectedly reported a second-quarter loss and cut its forecast for full-year operating profit. The Darmstadt, Germany-based company had a loss of 84 million euros ($122 million) in the quarter, compared with net income of 187 million euros a year earlier, and said operating profit will be about 1 billion euros this year due to one-time adjustments. The stock sank 4.8 percent to 73.76 euros. Peugeot Sinks Peugeot lost 7.6 percent to 27.26 euros after Europe’s second-largest carmaker abandoned a goal of increasing second- half earnings at the automotive division. Bank stocks posted the biggest decline among 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600. Santander retreated 3.2 percent to 7.34 euros as second- quarter profit dropped 38 percent after Spanish loan provisions surged and it set aside funds for customers mis-sold personal- loan insurance in the U.K. UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy ’s largest bank, fell 4.3 percent to 1.22 euros and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) lost 5.1 percent to 1.57 euros. Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) slid 4.3 percent to 42.24 pence and Banco Comercial Portugues SA retreated 6.7 percent to 30.5 euro cents. Italy, Spain Bonds Italian and Spanish government bonds slumped amid speculation Europe’s aid package may not be sufficient to prevent contagion. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the government is against a “blank check” for the European Financial Stability Facility to buy bonds of troubled euro members in the secondary market. Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) slid 5.6 percent to 13.54 euros even after the Portuguese retailer reported increased profit. The company said the second half is “expected to be marked by the sharp drop in consumption and by the increased financial difficulties of the Portuguese.”  Distribuidora Internacional de Alimentacion SA, the Madrid- based discount retailer spun off from Carrefour SA this month, sank 6.3 percent to 3.07 euros. Alcatel-Lucent SA, France’s largest telecommunications equipment supplier, dropped 6.9 percent to 3.38 euros as U.S. rival Juniper Networks Inc. reported sales and profit that missed estimates. Meda AB (MEDAA) rallied 6.7 percent to 75.80 kronor as two people with knowledge of the matter said Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. approached the Swedish company about a takeover. The approach was informal and may not lead to a deal, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the situation is private. Provident Financial Plc (PFG) climbed 8.4 percent to 1,115 pence after the U.K.’s biggest publicly traded subprime lender posted first-half profit that beat analyst estimates as bad loans declined.

{"headline": "Vomiting-Bug Vaccine Seen as Shot in the Arm for Cruises", "article": "(Corrects spelling of executive’s name in second paragraph.) As a new strain of stomach flu leaves a trail of stomach-clenching illness from Sydney to San Diego , scientists are moving closer to thwarting it for good. Early stage human studies on a vaccine against norovirus , the top source of gastroenteritis in the U.S., are set to finish this year. That would make work on the vaccine, developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) , the farthest along of several immunization candidates. A course of shots may confer lifelong protection against 95 percent of strains, said Rajeev Venkayya, who heads the Japanese drugmaker’s vaccines unit. A norovirus vaccine would be a boon to cruise ships , schools and nursing homes struggling to deal with a highly contagious, untreatable scourge. Of the 21 million people infected in the U.S. annually, about 800 die, mostly the very young and the elderly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Given the highly infectious nature of norovirus and its ability to cause extensive outbreaks in hospitals, elder-care facilities and cruise ships, there is a need for prophylactic and preventative approaches to guard against infection,” said Peter White, a microbiology professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. A vaccine “would be particularly important for individuals with a high risk of exposure” or weakened immune defenses, he said. White’s lab last year helped characterize the new variant, dubbed GII.4 Sydney for the city in which was first identified. The germ was responsible for the worst bout of gastroenteritis in a decade in Australia ’s Victoria state and has sparked outbreaks worldwide since March 2012. Nausea, Vomiting Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, can be caught from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces, according to the CDC. It causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed, resulting in pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Most outbreaks occur from November to April in the U.S. If approved, Takeda’s norovirus vaccine would be the first to protect people against the germ. It would potentially add as much as $400 million in annual revenue for the Osaka-based drugmaker, said Atsushi Seki, a health-care analyst at Barclays Plc in Tokyo. Takeda fell 0.6 percent to 4,280 yen at the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, paring to 11 percent its gain in 2013. That’s less than half the 24 percent advance of the Topix index. The benchmark index declined 0.9 percent today. $273 Million Cost In children younger than 5 years, norovirus caused 14,000 hospitalizations and 281,000 emergency room visits in 2009 and 2010 in the U.S., amounting to $273 million in annual treatment costs, the CDC said in a statement in March. Takeda’s vaccine candidate combines viral components from two norovirus types that laboratory studies suggest should fight all strains known to have circulated during the past 20 years, including the Sydney one, Venkayya said in an interview. Studies of the vaccine in healthy volunteers began in May 2012. Takeda, Asia’s largest drugmaker, plans further tests in children and the elderly, and a larger study to gauge the efficacy of one or two shots, he said, adding that it will be “several years” before the vaccine is ready for sale. “I’m optimistic for this vaccine,” he said. “It continues to look very good to us.” Takeda took over development of the vaccine when it bought Bozeman, Montana-based LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year for an initial payment of $60 million. Takeda will pay LigoCyte more based on the vaccine’s success. The acquisition is part of Takeda’s strategy to tap the $25.3 billion global vaccines market. Gates Foundation Venkayya was previously director for global health delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where he oversaw the foundation’s work on polio eradication and introducing vaccines. At least two other groups besides Takeda are developing vaccines against norovirus. UMN Pharma Inc. (4585) , based in Yokohama, Japan , and Finland’s University of Tampere are developing UMN-2003, which aims to protect against rotavirus, another cause of viral gastroenteritis. Charles Arntzen, professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology, is also working on one at Arizona State University in Tucson. All three vaccine candidates are based on virus-like particles -- proteins that resemble key components of the virus, enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the pathogens. Scientists are developing new weapons to fight norovirus years after they successfully produced vaccines against rotavirus. The delay reflects the difficulty of researching norovirus, which can’t be grown outside the human body, said White at the University of New South Wales. Glaxo, Merck GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) sold 360 million pounds ($556 million) of its Rotarix vaccine for rotavirus last year, while Merck & Co. (MRK) ’s RotaTeq generated $601 million. While long-term care facilities and schools are especially prone to outbreaks, new epidemics of acute gastro often emerge on cruise ships, where control is hindered by close living quarters and shared dining areas. With regular turnover of passengers, noroviruses on ships can repeatedly infect new travelers, researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Control in Bilthoven, Netherlands , found in a 2008 study. This year, six cruise ships, including Celebrity Cruises Inc.’s Millennium, Solstice and Infinity, have had norovirus outbreaks on board, the CDC in Atlanta said.

{"headline": "Longest Win Streak Since 1975 Completed by Tokyo’s Small Listed Companies", "article": "Small Tokyo-listed companies have capped the longest streak of daily advances in almost 37 years. Japan ’s TSE Second Section Price Index (TSE2) , a capitalization- weighted index of smaller companies listed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, added 0.2 percent to 2,308.56 at the 3 p.m. close today, rising for a 26th consecutive day. That’s the longest streak since May 13, 1975, said Takamichi Sugawara, an assistant manager in the information service division of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Even after rising for 26 days, shares on the index trade at an average of 0.68 times book value , compared with 1 times for the Topix Index, Japan’s broadest gauge, and 1.24 times for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. A number less than one means that companies can be bought for less than value of their assets. The streak “suggests money is flowing into the Japanese market across the board,” said Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. “The TSE’s second section is a market that’s very undervalued. That’s another reason behind investors buying the shares.” Companies on the Tokyo bourse’s second section should have at least 800 shareholders and a market value of at least 2 billion yen ($25 million), bourse spokeswoman Yukari Hozumi said by telephone. For inclusion in the first section, where Toyota Motor Corp. and Canon Inc. are listed, companies are required to have at least 2,200 shareholders and market capitalization of 50 billion yen or more. Nippon Seiki Co., which makes instrument panels for cars and boats, and Kabuki-za Co., which owns a traditional Japanese theater and runs restaurants, are the biggest companies on the Topix second section by market value.

{"headline": "Obama Stripped to Skeleton Staff in a Government Shutdown", "article": "A U.S. government shutdown means President Barack Obama will have fewer people to cook meals, do the laundry, clean the floors or change the light bulbs , according to a White House contingency plan. About three-fourths of president’s 1,701-person staff would be sent home. The national security team would be cut back, fewer economists would be tracking the economy and there wouldn’t be as many budget officials to track spending. White House policy decisions on the environment and drug policy might get postponed, as the executive mansion struggles to cope with a shutdown of the government. “If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday -- the end of the fiscal year -- they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on,” Obama said yesterday in the White House briefing room. Lawmakers have reached an impasse in their search for compromise legislation to fund the government. The House and Senate have passed different versions of the bill, which must be reconciled and approved by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year or the government would shut down. The congressional dispute would leave the White House with a bare-bones staff, according to the plan submitted Sept. 26. The executive office of the president would designate approximately 436 employees as “excepted,” or exempt from furlough to perform their jobs. The remaining 1,265 employees would be sent home. The president and Vice President Joe Biden are exempt from furlough. First Day Work will continue “with a limited number of employees to sustain minimal excepted operations,” according to the plan. Like other agencies, most White House workers are being directed to work on the first day of the shutdown for about four hours winding down activities, securing and closing computer files before going home. Top White House aides, political appointees and officials requiring Senate confirmation are permitted to work. Of the total, 438 people work directly for the president. Under a shutdown, 129 could continue working, according to the contingency plan. Biden, who has a staff of 24, would have had to make do with 12. Of the 90 people who maintain the president’s family living quarters, only 15 would remain to provide “minimum maintenance and support.” Contingency Plans Obama’s national security staff of 66 would be cut to 42. Similar staff cuts would be imposed at the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which are all part of the president’s executive office. Agencies throughout the federal government have submitted contingency plans to the budget office to be implemented in the event of a shutdown. It marks the second time in Obama’s presidency this has happened -- many of this year’s plans track closely with preparations put together during a similar scenario in 2011.

{"headline": "Japan’s Industry Minister Kaieda to Step Down After Nuclear Plant Disaster", "article": "Japan ’s industry minister, Banri Kaieda , said he will resign after replacing three officials in charge of energy policy and outlining a new structure for the ministry following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The new structure will separate the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry, addressing the conflict inherent in the dual roles of promoting and regulating the nuclear industry. That conflict has been highlighted in the last week by revelations the regulator urged utilities to influence public opinion in favor of nuclear energy. The disaster at Fukushima capped decades of faked safety reports and fatal accidents in Japan’s atomic industry. Kaieda said in a meeting with reporters yesterday that the dismissal of the ministry’s top bureaucrat and the heads of agencies in charge of nuclear oversight and energy policy are part of “sweeping” changes. The outgoing officials are Kazuo Matsunaga, 59, the ministry’s vice minister; Tetsuhiro Hosono, 58, director general of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy; and Nobuaki Terasaka, 58, the director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Leadership Shuffle The leadership change isn’t enough to tackle failures that contributed to the Fukushima disaster, according to a former industry ministry official. “To account for the huge mess in Fukushima, they should fire all the director generals in the ministry, or dismantle it entirely,” said Hiroyuki Kishi, now a professor at the Graduate School of Media Design at Keio University. He described the move as “cosmetic,” saying the bureaucrats were due to leave the ministry as part of a regular reshuffle. The new appointments will be made from within the ministry. Kenyu Adachi, 52, director general of the Economic and Industrial Policy Bureau, will replace Matsunaga. Hosono will be replaced by Ichiro Takahara, 54, director general of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, while Hiroyuki Fukano, 54, the director general of Commerce and Distribution Policy Group, will be appointed chief of the Nuclear Industrial Safety Agency, or NISA. NISA, which lists one of its codes of conduct as “neutrality and justice,” will be separated from METI to give it more independence, the government said last month. Kaieda said he will step down sometime after the appointments become official, which the ministry said would be Aug. 12, and after an outline for the new ministry structure is in place. Emitting Radiation Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima plant has been emitting radiation since an earthquake and tsunami on March 11 knocked out power and cooling, causing three reactor meltdowns and hydrogen explosions. The accident is rated at the highest level on a severity scale, the same as the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986. Tokyo Electric ignored warnings about the tsunami risks that caused the crisis at Fukushima, according to Tatsuya Ito, who represented Fukushima prefecture in the national parliament from 1991 to 2003. Chubu Electric Power Co., one of the country’s regional electricity monopolies, said on July 29 the nuclear regulator asked the utility to prepare questions favoring atomic power for a public hearing in 2007. Kyushu Electric Kyushu Electric Power Co. earlier said it asked staffers at affiliates to send e-mails supporting the restart of reactors to an internet-broadcast show run by METI on plant safety. A NISA official asked Kyushu Electric, Shikoku Electric Power Co. and Tohoku Electric Power Co. to send employees to a symposium on nuclear power to influence public opinion, Kyodo News reported this week. An independent panel may be set up to investigate the alleged attempts to sway opinion by the regulator and Japan’s power companies, Kaieda said. “We will cooperate with the investigation when requested,” said Takumi Koyamada, a NISA spokesman reached by telephone.

{"headline": "U.S. Bus Riders Surge as Free Wi-Fi Beats Driving", "article": "Megabus.com and BoltBus led U.S. curbside bus companies that boosted trips by 32 percent this year as travelers opted to leave their cars behind and surf the Internet while traveling, DePaul University researchers said. The popularity of U.S. intercity buses picking up passengers at the curb rather than in a terminal has been growing since the industry reversed a 46-year decline in 2006, Joseph Schwieterman, director of DePaul’s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development in Chicago , said in a telephone interview. Bus traffic including traditional service grew this year at the fastest pace since 2008, the institute said in a study released today. Higher gasoline costs make driving a car more expensive at the same time as buses offer access to free Wi-Fi and cheaper fares than on planes and trains, Schwieterman said. Once viewed as a last resort in the U.S., bus travel is now attracting more affluent riders, students and women traveling alone, he said. “Bus travel is suddenly cool,” Schwieterman said. “There’s a fatigue over driving combined with a revitalized image of the bus.” Exceeds Airline Gains Daily intercity curbside bus departures increased to 778 from 589 a year ago, according to a DePaul study to be published today. Scheduled departures for the total bus industry, which includes Greyhound Lines, increased 7.1 percent to 2,693. That compares with a gain of 1.5 percent for airline seat miles and 1.2 percent for rail seat miles, according to the study. The institute’s annual snapshot of the bus industry is based on the number of industry wide departures on one Friday in December. As bus customers come back, fares are increasing, Schwieterman said. Routes where fares of $20 or less were once common are now seeing tickets priced at $35 or $40, he said. Megabus and BoltBus offer a limited number of seats for as little as $1 with advanced booking. Typical one-way New York-to- Washington Megabus fares range from $17 to $26, according to its website. BoltBus tickets range from $15 to $27. Safety Questions Regulators are questioning the safety of bus travel after 28 people died in eight crashes this year. The National Transportation Safety Board warned in an Oct. 31 study that curbside operators are seven times more likely to be involved in a fatal wreck than intercity lines with more conventional business models. Neither of the two largest U.S. curbside operators -- Stagecoach Group Plc (SGP) ’s Megabus and FirstGroup Plc (FGP) ’s BoltBus, a partnership between Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines Inc. -- were involved in this year’s fatal accidents. A Megabus coach traveling to Toronto crashed into a bridge outside Syracuse, New York, in September 2010, killing four. The NTSB’s warning about the dangers of curbside buses included so-called Chinatown operators, which can operate under multiple names, the board said. The DePaul researchers don’t include Chinatown companies in their calculations because the operators tend to pool their buses, may not run them under independent brands, and may also use unmarked, leased buses, Schwieterman said. Adding Routes New routes helped drive growth. BoltBus set up a hub in Newark , New Jersey , with 40 daily buses to Baltimore, Boston , Philadelphia and Washington, the study said. Aberdeen, Scotland- based FirstGroup also began Greyhound Express in Chicago and on the East Coast, and plans to expand further, according to the study. FirstGroup is experiencing across-the-board growth on U.S. routes, said Timothy Stokes, a spokesman for the company’s U.S. subsidiary based in Cincinnati. Station-based Greyhound routes are gaining as well as curbside BoltBus and luxury Greyhound Express, he said. “People are spending their money more wisely,” Stokes said. “They’re weighing their options more wisely.” Megabus opened new hubs in Pittsburgh, with 38 departures, and Atlanta, with 29. Its Chicago and New York hubs appear to now be profitable, the study said. Stagecoach is based in Perth, Scotland. More traffic in existing hubs in New York , Chicago and Philadelphia is also bolstering growth, said Bryony Chamberlain, director of Megabus USA. “We’ve come in with a product which is new and brings the long-distance, intercity buses to a new market,” Chamberlain said in a telephone interview. “It’s much nicer to be sitting there being driven somewhere than sitting in traffic.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Plungis in Washington at  jplungis@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bernard Kohn at  bkohn2@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미국 장거리 버스 여행의 인기가 높아진 이유는 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미국 장거리 버스 여행의 안전성에 대한 우려는 무엇이며, 어떤 회사들이 이에 연루되어 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "미국 장거리 버스 여행의 성장세가 지속될 수 있을지, 그리고 어떤 요인들이 이에 영향을 미칠 수 있을지 분석해보세요."}]}
{"headline": "Higher Oil Futures Margins May Boost Volatility, IEA Says", "article": "Rising margin requirements in oil futures trading may increase volatility and concentrate market share in the hands of large speculators, the International Energy Agency said. The Obama administration proposed rules on April 17 to strengthen the oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to give it authority to raise margin requirements in oil futures trading. “If we consider raising margin requirements to a very high level through regulations to combat speculation, then we might find that certain trader groups, especially the hedgers and cash-constrained small speculators, will be driven out of the market,” the Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations said today in its monthly Oil Market Report. This would increase “concentration share where few traders, especially large traders, participate in the price discovery” and lead to “more volatile, rather than more stable, oil markets.” The IEA report also said that while higher margins may increase oil price volatility they may have “no effect on price levels ,” a reference to the overall price direction trend, which depends on physical supply and demand. Separately, CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest futures exchange, said on May 2 it would raise margins for non-hedged accounts from May 7 to comply with new regulations. On May 4, the CME received from U.S. regulators a 90-day extension for implementing those changes, under which members would have been treated as speculators for outright positions, paying a higher margin.

{"headline": "InBev Takeover Dilutes Loyalty to Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis", "article": "St. Louis Cardinals fans are seeing something they never expected at Busch Stadium: craft beer flowing beside the Budweiser taps. Until a couple of months ago, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s namesake baseball park allowed Schlafly draft beer to be sold at just one concession stand. Now eight sell it. “It’s like people are finally realizing that there is more than just a Bud,” said Mark Schwartz, 53, a season-ticket holder at the St. Louis Rams’ Edward Jones Dome, where Schlafly debuted for football fans this season. “It’s great to root on your hometown team with a hometown beer.” Generations of local loyalty is eroding in the wake of InBev’s 2008 hostile takeover of Anheuser-Busch -- a St. Louis tradition since 1852, when it was called Bavarian. For Schlafly and other small breweries in the city, it’s an opportunity to exploit the increased interest in craft beers nationwide. Drinking Bud in St. Louis used to be like driving a Ford or Chrysler in Detroit. Bars, restaurants and catering companies didn’t want to offend the company or its fans by offering other brands, said Mike Sweeney, a systems administrator and former part-time tour guide at Schlafly who runs a beer blog called STL Hops. Then Leuven, Belgium-based InBev bought Anheuser-Busch in November 2008 and by Christmas had trimmed about 1,400 U.S. jobs, three-quarters of them in St. Louis. They ranged from executives to brewery workers in a city where the baseball stadium carries the name of Anheuser-Busch’s founding family. Team Ties The brewer owned the Cardinals for more than four decades before selling the team in 1996. For years, the ballpark organist played the Budweiser theme song at games. “Now there’s a bit more ambivalence to AB: They’re just another major world company,” said Sweeney, 31, whose three- year-old website has attracted 50,000 visitors and a million page views in the past six months. “You don’t have that same hometown pride.” The AB InBev unit’s market share and number of tap handles in St. Louis are stable and its share in professional sports stadiums remains “exceptionally strong,” said Dave Peacock , president of the U.S. unit, Anheuser-Busch. “We have a strong bond with St. Louis and the people here, and they return the sentiment,” Peacock said. “We never take any beer sale for granted, whether it’s in St. Louis or anywhere across the United States.” Craft Surge Craft beers are a growing trend everywhere, he said, pointing out that Anheuser’s Shock Top wheat beer and AmberBock are sold at Busch Stadium and Edward Jones Dome. The Brewers Association, a Boulder, Colorado-based trade group for craft and microbreweries, calls such beers from major brewers “domestic specialties.” It defines craft beers as those less than 25 percent-owned by a large brewer and producing less than 2 million barrels a year. U.S. sales of craft beers increased 13 percent in the year ended Oct. 3, according to Chicago-based researcher SymphonyIRI Group. Domestic premiums such as Bud Light, the country’s best- selling beer, declined almost 3 percent. Businesses that serve beer see a turn in customer attitudes. Chris Sommers opened Pi Pizzeria in St. Louis six months before the InBev takeover and offered only microbrews as a way to stand out. “People were really angry with us in the beginning,” said Sommers, 34, whose restaurant now features Schlafly Pi Common, a custom-made brew. “After the takeover, that all changed. The anger shifted.” No More Grief Customers “come into our restaurant now and don’t even give us grief anymore, because they don’t think of AB as local,” he said. Some competitors come from Anheuser-Busch’s own ranks. Its stock even financed one entrepreneur. Urban Chestnut Brewing Co. was started by Florian Kuplent, a brewmaster who helped create Shock Top, and David Wolfe, 43, who was senior director of consumer strategy and innovation. Both left Anheuser-Busch earlier this year. Kuplent, 36, said he doesn’t see himself as a serious challenger to his former employer. “The more specialty brewers there are, the better it is for everybody,” he said. “There is space for everybody.” Tom Schlafly, 62, used Anheuser-Busch stock as part of the collateral for a loan to start Schlafly. He and partner Dan Kopman founded the brewery two decades ago. Last Laugh “They laughed at us when we first opened in 1991 -- a microbrewery in St. Louis, home of the Bud?” said Kopman, 49, who bills Schlafly Bottleworks as “St. Louis’s first new production brewery since the end of Prohibition.” Local restaurant and bar owners often spouted the same refrain when Kopman first tried to persuade them to serve his brands: They already stocked all the beers. “Of course, what they meant by ‘all’ was that they served the full lineup of Anheuser-Busch beers, and not just Bud and Bud Light,” Kopman said. AB InBev also makes Bud Ice, Michelob and Busch brands. Kopman said Schlafly expects to sell about 35,500 barrels this year, up from 9,600 in 2003. AB InBev shares have more than doubled to $43.72 from $18.25 since Nov. 18, 2008, the day it closed the Anheuser-Busch purchase. Yet St. Louis tastes continue to shift. Carleen Kramer, vice president of Catering St. Louis , said clients’ preferences have changed since the company was founded 30 years ago. It served only Anheuser-Busch products because that’s all people wanted to drink. Brother Bud “Your brother didn’t have a job if you didn’t drink AB beer,” said Kramer, 57. “It was about loyalty.’ That changed after the takeover led employees in St. Louis to worry about their jobs. Catering St. Louis has increased the proportion of Schlaflys it stocks. “It’s given people permission to try something new,” Kramer said. “Schlafly is the little guy, the underdog.” Delaware North Cos ., which holds the beer-vending concession license at Busch Stadium and Edward Jones Dome, noticed the growing interest in Schlaflys and decided to give them a try. “We wanted to see if that product line had legs,” said Dan Fetcho, regional director for the Buffalo, New York-based vendor’s Sportservice subsidiary. “Schlafly is a local flavor that has become more and more mainstream.” Boutique Brew That popularity may not carry the brand beyond its boutique status. Brewers whose output exceeds 60,000 barrels a year are required to pay the same $18-a-barrel excise tax as the world’s biggest brewers, according to the Brewers Association , which is working to get the law changed. For now, small brewers are growing one tap at a time, in venues such as the Edward Jones Dome, where Christopher Field manages the only beer stand carrying Schlafly. It’s in Section 104, near a corner of the north end zone. “People were coming from the other side of the dome just to buy it,” he said, noting the new preference as fans rushed to place orders during last call at a recent game. “People were saying, ‘All I want is one more Schlafly.’” To contact the reporters on this story: Angie Lau in Chicago at  alau42@bloomberg.net ; Duane D.

{"headline": "InterMune Doubles After European Panel Backs Esbriet Respiratory Drug", "article": "InterMune Inc. had a record gain in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading after a European regulatory committee recommended approval of its medicine Esbriet to treat a fatal lung disease. InterMune rose $20.62 to $34.89 at 4 p.m. New York time, more than doubling in the stock’s biggest increase since the Brisbane, California-based company first sold shares to the public in March 2000. The European Commission is expected to ratify the committee’s decision in two to three months, the drugmaker said today in a statement. The drug isn’t approved for sale in the U.S., where regulators rejected the company’s application in May. The denial had sent shares down 75 percent. Peak sales in Europe may reach $1.2 billion, with the drug priced at $21,000 a year per patient, said Adam Cutler , an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. “This will drive significant sales and will enable the company to be profitable as soon as the end of 2011,” Cutler wrote today in a research note. Based in New York, Cutler raised his recommendation on InterMune shares to “buy.” The lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, “is among the most urgent of unmet medical needs in respiratory medicine,” said Roland du Bois, a professor of respiratory medicine at the National Heart & Lung Institute at Imperial College in London and co-chair of the program that tested InterMune’s medicine, in an InterMune statement today. More than 100,000 Europeans suffer from the disease, for which there are no approved therapies in the European Union, du Bois said. Appoints Team InterMune also said today that it appointed a team to prepare to sell the medicine in Europe, led by Giacomo Di Nepi , who joined the company in November 2009 after roles as chief executive officer of Osaka, Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s European business and global head for the Transplantation and Infectious Disease unit of Novartis Pharma AG. The company’s European headquarters will be in Basel, Switzerland, and it has established subsidiaries in Germany, Italy and the U.K. InterMune is in the final stages of establishing subsidiaries in France and Spain, and plans to have a European workforce of about 125 people by the end of 2012. In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked for a new clinical trial to prove the medicine delays progression of the disease, snubbing an advisory panel’s recommendation that the drug be approved. FDA Status The company plans to provide an update on the medicine’s status with the FDA in the first quarter of 2011, spokesman Jim Goff said in a telephone interview today. “We continue to evaluate various alternatives,” he said. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes an unexplained scarring and inflammation in the lungs and is usually fatal within five years. The condition mostly affects people ages 50 to 75, causing air sacs in the lung to be gradually replaced with scar tissue, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s website. Most patients die of respiratory failure when the lungs can’t expand to get oxygen into the bloodstream. To contact the reporter on this story: Meg Tirrell in New York at  mtirrell@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Sumitomo Life Sticks to Buying Japanese Bonds in Second Half", "article": "Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. plans to invest mainly in yen-denominated bonds in the fiscal second half after buying about 800 billion yen ($10 billion) worth of domestic debt in the first half to safeguard returns. The insurer, which has about 21 trillion yen in assets, will mainly invest in Japanese government bonds with longer maturities in the six months through March 31, said Yoshiteru Hata, deputy general manager at the insurer’s investment planning division. He declined to provide specific figures for the investment plan, citing company policy. Sumitomo Life is sticking to the relative safety of bonds on concerns that the global economy will remain weak amid Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and as Japan copes with the aftermath of the March earthquake. The government may sell about 1 trillion yen of bonds to fund the rebuilding of areas stricken by the record quake, said two government officials who declined to be identified because the plan isn’t public. “Japanese government bonds will remain our main investments,” Hata said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday. “We’ve added more than we had expected in the first half on prospects that the yield will come down. We have no intention to earn returns by betting on riskier assets such as equities.” Sumitomo Life doesn’t have any investments in Portugal , Ireland, Italy , Greece and Spain , Hata said. The five European nations had their sovereign ratings cut. Japan’s sovereign bonds earned 2.4 percent in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch index. The Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock Average slumped 11 percent. Redeeming Hedge Fund Sumitomo Life expects demand for loans to remain weak, as many higher-rated companies are taking advantage of the strengthening yen to raise funds overseas, Hata said. Loan balance decreased by about 100 billion yen in the first half, according to the insurer. Holdings of overseas bonds and equities remained unchanged in the fiscal first half and investment decisions will hinge on market moves for the second half, Hata said. Domestic stock holdings declined in the first half as the insurer redeemed its investment in a fund-of-hedge funds, Hata said. The insurer remains “cautious” about investing in domestic stocks in the second half, while real estate holdings will remain unchanged, he said. Following are Sumitomo Life’s market forecasts for the fiscal second half through March 2012. The ranges refer to where the insurer expects securities to trade during the period.

{"headline": "The College SAT: Higher Costs, Lower Relevance", "article": "Paying someone to take the SAT test on your behalf -- as six Long Island students were recently charged with doing -- is illegal. If convicted, the students could face jail time for their offense. That's justice, however sad. The episode points up the absurdities that have grown up like ivy around the long revered -- and increasingly criticized -- SAT. Many parents spend vast amounts of money, from SAT prep courses to private tutoring, for a test that, according to some college officials, isn't that predictive of how well students will perform in college. You might ask yourself, 'Isn't that the point of the SAT'? But shaky justification has done nothing to slow the flow of money into everything and anything related to the test. Gaming The System The alleged cheating scandal is \"part and parcel of the test score arms race out there now,\" says Robert Schaeffer, public education director at FairTest, a nonprofit that monitors the testing industry. \"Kids believe they need to raise scores by any means possible.\" Says Elizabeth Wissner-Gross, an international educational strategist hired to help students prepare for college: “People are desperate to get their kids into certain colleges.” In the get-into-college game, desperation quickly converts into cash. The smallest alleged payment to the test taker, $1,500, wouldn't cover one of the most basic SAT prep courses. The small-group SAT review course given by the Princeton Review consists of 24 hours of instruction and costs $1,600. The company's priciest one-on-one tutoring package in New York costs $8,400, and some professional tutors charge up to $800 an hour. If students such as the alleged cheaters are cynical about college admissions, it’s because “students understand it’s a system they can game,” says Wake Forest University Professor Joseph Soares. A critic of universities’ reliance on test scores, Soares is the editor of the book “SAT Wars: The Case for Test-Optional College Admissions,” released Sept. 30. Investments in test prep can pay off, to a point. According to FairTest, it boosts SAT scores an average of 100 to 120 points. Yet if the point of using the SAT is to determine how well a student will do in college, they're not that valuable, say critics. A study in Soares’ book shows that a 200-point difference in SAT scores makes virtually no difference in the grades college students get. High school grades, meanwhile, provide valuable information on how likely a student is to get good grades and complete a bachelor’s degree, he says. Kathleen Steinberg, spokesperson for the College Board , which administers the SAT, strongly disagrees. She says research, including a 2008 College Board study, shows that standardized test scores do help predict success in the first year of college. As well, “the SAT helps admission officers put high school grades in perspective,” she says. Colleges are casting their own vote and increasingly it's thumbs down. The number of accredited colleges that don't require all or most applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores has grown to about a third, according to FairTest. That includes prominent New England liberal arts schools such as Smith College , Bowdoin College, and Bates College, as well as Wake Forest University. The College Board cites its own statistics. Steinberg says that of the 1,500 most selective four-year not-for-profit colleges in the U.S. about 5% do not require standardized test scores \"for the main body of students.\" Many test-optional schools still receive test scores from most applicants, she adds, and use them in admissions decisions. Doubters Abound DePaul University, a 25,000-student school, will convert to a test-optional policy starting with next year's class. Chicago-based DePaul made the decision after four years of comparing incoming student test scores with later academic performance. Other criteria, such as grades in college-preparation courses and involvement in extracurricular activities, were much better markers of future success, says Father Dennis Holtschneider, the university's president. Only some students can afford test prep courses and take tests multiple times, he says. “We’re trying to level the playing field a little bit by using something that’s a much better predictor.” Standardized test scores are also losing importance at Fairfield University. Starting with 2010's incoming class, it made test scores optional. For years before that, \"test scores were becoming less and less a factor for us,\" says director of undergraduate admission Karen Pellegrino. \"The hardest thing is making students believe that we're really not looking at them.\" Where the SAT's value soars is when it is used to get money. Standardized test scores remain very important in getting scholarships, including the National Merit Scholarship. “It is a smart economic decision to purchase [test] coaching for that reason,” says FairTest's Schaeffer. A small increase in scores can make a student eligible for thousands of dollars in extra scholarship money. That means many students are at a disadvantage in getting that money. On the SAT, men score higher than women, whites higher than blacks, and students with upper middle class backgrounds higher than working-class students, according to Soares. Says Schaeffer: \"The thing that SATs measure best is socioeconomic status.” To contact the writer on this story: Ben Steverman at bsteverman@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor on this story: Suzanne Woolley at swoolley2@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "SAT 시험 준비에 대한 투자가 평균적으로 얼마나 SAT 점수를 향상시키는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "SAT 점수가 대학에서의 학업 성적을 예측하는 데 얼마나 유용한지에 대한 비판적인 관점은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "SAT 점수가 학생의 사회경제적 지위를 가장 잘 반영한다는 주장은 어떤 근거를 가지고 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "Batista Warns Short Sellers That Bets Against Him Will Backfire", "article": "Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista warned short sellers wagering against his companies that they’ll regret their bets, according to posts on his Twitter account. Asked by other Twitter users about the companies’ falling stock prices, Batista wrote on March 23 that “rumors and gossip are the tools of short sellers,” who will be “caught with their pants down.” Short sellers borrow shares and sell them in order to profit from buying them later at a lower price. Batista posted on Twitter a day after his companies came under renewed selling pressure on the Sao Paulo exchange on concerns they’re losing access to the financing needed to carry out investment plans. Shares of OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , Batista’s shipbuilding and oil services unit, plunged 17 percent to a record-low 4.88 reais at the close of trading. Oil company OGX Petroleo (OGXP3) & Gas Participacoes SA fell 9.2 percent. OGX has fallen 48 percent this year, and OSX is down 54 percent. Batista, whose personal wealth has fallen about $25 billion as the value of his companies declined in the past year, faces demands from creditors to boost collateral, people familiar with the matter said last week. OSX is planning to sell $265 million in secured bonds due in June 2014, a person familiar with the plans said on March 15. There is no collateral demand from creditors, said a person close to Batista's holding company, EBX Group Co., on March 22. Esteves Interview Batista’s units have the “necessary funding established for the coming years,” EBX Group said in an e-mailed statement on March 19. In his Twitter posts, Batista referred readers to an interview with Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) President Andre Esteves published online March 23 by Estado de S. Paulo. Batista’s companies are in no danger of failing and he remains one of the best-capitalized businessmen in Brazil, Esteves is quoted by the Sao-Paulo based newspaper as saying.

BTG has extended Batista credit lines in the range of 1 billion reais ($498 million), Esteves said, according to Estado. Bloomberg News reported on March 7 that BTG provided a $1 billion credit line to EBX, according to a person with direct knowledge of the agreement. Asked on Twitter if it’s not time to start talking about what he is doing with his companies, Batista posted, “We’re going to turn on the communications engines.” Pointing out that the port he’s building at Acu in Rio de Janeiro state will help ease logistical logjams, he wrote: “It’s not I who needs help, it’s Brazil.” To contact the reporters on this story: Juan Pablo Spinetto in Rio de Janeiro at  jspinetto@bloomberg.net ; Alex Cuadros in Sao Paulo at  acuadros@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at  asoliani@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "공매도는 어떤 방식으로 이익을 얻으려고 하는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "브라질에서 Eike Batista의 회사들이 직면한 자금 조달 문제는 그들의 투자 계획에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "BTG Pactual의 신용 연장이 Eike Batista의 회사들의 재무 건전성과 시장 신뢰도에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "BOX Exchange Gets SEC OK to Trade Jumbo S&P 500 ETF Options", "article": "BOX Options Exchange, the third- smallest of 11 U.S. options venues, will be the first to begin trading larger-size contracts on the most-active U.S. equity derivatives product, according to a company executive. BOX will list and trade contracts based on 1,000 shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust starting May 10, according to Ed Boyle, senior vice president for strategy at the Boston-based exchange. The so-called jumbo options, approved May 3 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be 10 times larger than existing contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index exchange- traded fund, known by the ticker symbol SPY. The contract is designed to give institutional investors another way to trade the S&P 500 at a time when many asset managers are increasing their use of ETFs as part of their investment strategies. Institutions often use larger-size contracts like S&P 500 options that enable them to buy or sell bigger positions without signaling their intentions and moving the market. “We see customer demand for the product because it offers flexibility to institutions and traders looking for larger notional size in trades,” Boyle said by phone. “It also provides additional price competition across indexes and ETFs.” The contracts, which will be a separate product from the regular-size options based on 100 shares of the S&P 500 ETF, also offer an alternative to indexes such as the S&P 500, which trades exclusively on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , Boyle said. ETF Popularity Some 18 percent of institutional investors in the U.S. now have ETFs among their holdings, up from 14 percent in 2012, according to a report today from research firm Greenwich Associates. BOX’s pricing, which will be announced in the middle of this week, will not be the standard taker/maker structure the venue uses for many options, Boyle said. The taker/maker regime pays firms to trade with bids and offers on the exchange and charges those providing quotes. If daily average volume exceeds 20,000 contracts by the end of the year, BOX will consider the jumbo SPY options a success, Boyle said. The exchange may ask the SEC for permission to introduce jumbo options on other actively traded ETFs including those based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq-100 Index, he said. Other options exchanges are likely to list and trade jumbo SPY (SPY) options, Boyle said.

{"headline": "NRA Win After 2012 Losses Shows Gap With Control Allies", "article": "The National Rifle Association used the threat of an election-year backlash to tamp down U.S. Senate support for expanded background checks on gun sales -- even though the lobbying group lost almost every race it spent money on during the 2012 campaign. The NRA’s power to sway federal lawmakers stems from its ability to motivate what it says are 4.5 million members to go to the polls, Democratic and Republican strategists said. So far gun-control groups haven’t proved an equal counterweight. “I’m sure the NRA is popping champagne corks,” Senator Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, said as he walked off the Senate floor yesterday. Harkin voted for the background-check measure, which failed to reach the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. Voting to support the proposal were 54 senators, while 46 opposed it. President Barack Obama blamed the demise of a compromise version of his gun legislation package on the NRA and similar groups and said advocates of change need to be “as passionate and as organized and as vocal” as they are. “The real impact is going to have to come from the voters,” Obama said in the White House Rose Garden after the vote as victims of gun violence stood by his side. “You need to let your representative in Congress know that you are disappointed, and if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.” NRA Scorecard The NRA had announced on April 10 that senators’ votes on the gun bill and its amendments would be included in its legislative scorecard that measures, on an “A” to “F” scale, lawmakers’ support for the group’s agenda. “If the NRA didn’t score this, we’d have had 15 more votes,” Senator Joe Manchin , a West Virginia Democrat and co-sponsor of the background-check amendment, said today on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. The outcome of the four-month debate over gun control illustrates the imbalance between the experienced NRA and the pro-control organizations emerging in recent years that have yet to match its messaging and grassroots mobilizing. Former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was injured in a shooting in Tucson in 2011, appealed to supporters of her gun-control political committee after the vote. If the Senate won’t vote for new gun laws, she said in the e-mail, “then we need to change the members of the Senate.” Election Challenge New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a co-founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, made a similar pledge today at a news conference at Rockefeller University in Manhattan. The mayor, 71 and a billionaire, is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. “You voted to have people out there who are mentally ill and criminals, who’ve proven they’re bad people, to have guns on the streets,” he said to the senators who opposed the bill. “The next time you run for office, I’m going to be working for the other side.” Yet to make inroads, challenges facing gun-control advocates include piercing the NRA’s intimidating reputation for beating elected officials who stray on the gun control issue. Vice President Joe Biden , who presided over the vote on background checks, said earlier yesterday during an online chat that one member of Congress he had met with spoke forthrightly about why he would vote against a plan that polls show is supported by as much as 90 percent of the public. Showing Up “The 10 percent who don’t agree, they’re going to show up, and the 90 percent who think it’s a good idea, they’re not going to vote for me or against me because of how I vote on this,” Biden said the member told him. Biden advised those watching the chat: “You gotta say, ’This means the most to me.’” Biden’s Capitol Hill conversation reflects what political scientists and congressional analysts have been saying: Gun owners are far more likely to be single-issue voters than gun- control advocates. Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein wrote March 28 on his website, “A Plain Blog About Politics,” that the “problem here is equating ’90 percent in the polls’ with ’calling for change.’” Passionate Base The NRA has at its disposal a passionate base of supporters, which it stokes with angry and sometimes exaggerated rhetoric about gun measures. Obama said yesterday that the gun lobby “willfully lied” about the background-check measure, telling its members it would start a gun registry. The legislation included a provision specifically banning such a roster of gun owners. PolitiFact, a St. Petersburg, Florida-based group that fact-checks political ads, labeled the NRA assertion a “pants on fire” false statement. “NRA members are what people in the activism world call champions,” said Blain Rethmeier, a Republican strategist and former press secretary on Capitol Hill. “They are more than supporters. They are willing to take action and see to it that you don’t get re-elected. The senators know this.” Senator John Boozman , a NRA “A-rated” Republican from Arkansas, said he received “lots of mail” from constituents on the gun-regulation legislation, “probably as much mail as I’ve received on any issue.” ‘Very Concerned’ Boozman said the sentiment is split “probably 80-20” percent opposed to more restrictions on gun purchases. “They are just very concerned in this climate that somebody is going to confiscate their guns,” he said in an interview. He voted against the background-check expansion. Senator John McCain , an Arizona Republican, said he has listened to “very passionate views on the issue. People feel strongly, they communicate.” Rated “B-plus” by the NRA, McCain voted in favor of the background-check measure. “I understand that will affect my rating with the NRA,” he said. Chris Cox, a spokesman for the Fairfax, Virginia-based NRA, said the expanded background checks “will not reduce violent crime.” The group, he said in a statement, will keep working with both parties on measures that help prosecute “violent criminals.” The NRA’s win on background checks comes after its losses last November, when the group spent millions of dollars in an unsuccessful bid to oust Obama and made a combined $4 million in investments in Senate races in Ohio, Virginia, Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin and Florida, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks political spending. All of the NRA-backed candidates in those Senate races lost. NRA Survivor Senator Tim Kaine , a Virginia Democrat with an “F” rating from the NRA, was one of the targeted candidates who overcame the gun lobby’s opposition to win his seat last year. He wrote in an April 9, 2013, opinion column in the Virginian-Pilot newspaper that “the power of the organization’s leadership is vastly overrated.” Just 5.2 percent of the $18 million the NRA spent on campaigns last year helped their preferred candidate win, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “Is the NRA as politically powerful as it used to be?” asked Jim Manley , a Democratic strategist and former Senate aide. “If you look at the Senate this afternoon, the answer is yes. But the fact is that there are large sections of the country where it just doesn’t resonate anymore.” 2014 Elections A challenge for gun-control advocates is that seats up for grabs in 2014 Senate races includes several in western states where the NRA’s voice can move voters. Four Democrats opposed the background-check legislation: Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. All represent states that backed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , who beat Obama in their states by an average margin of 18 percentage points. Baucus, Begich and Pryor are up for re- election next year. ‘Definitional’ Moment Geoffrey Garin, president of the polling firm Hart Research Associates, said yesterday that voting against gun legislation “becomes definitional, showing whether someone is in the mainstream or out of the mainstream.” In a conference call arranged by the Democratic National Committee , Garin said continued Republican opposition to gun legislation supported by most of the public risks “degradation” of the party’s brand. Gun-control groups and the NRA will enter the next campaign showdown with target lists provided by the Senate vote, and they have already begun spending money. Mayors Against Illegal Guns spent $12 million on television ads to pressure senators on the legislation, with the money coming from Bloomberg. Through his super-political action committee, Independence USA, he also has spent more than $10 million in federal elections this year and last, much of it aimed at defeating NRA-backed candidates. In another echo of the NRA, the mayors’ group announced that it, too, would rate members of Congress on their gun votes and publicize that information come election time. Organizing for Action, a nonprofit formed from remnants of Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, plans to hold events in the states of senators it sees as “key” to expanding background checks. This could include the Democratic senators who voted against the legislation. Breaking ‘Stranglehold’ “The gun lobby’s power overall is receding, as shown by the last election,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal , a Connecticut Democrat who overcame $100,000 in NRA attack ads in his 2010 election. “The special interests like the NRA have long held a stranglehold, but we’re determined to break it.” Reaching a majority of the Senate to favor expanded background checks -- as well as last week achieving the 60 votes needed to even consider the gun bill, S. 649 -- showed that the gun lobby’s power is waning, Blumenthal said. “Just 4 1/2 months ago, this topic was politically untouchable,” he said in an interview. “About 10 days ago, 60 votes was completely unreachable. We reached 60 votes last week to continue the debate, and I think we can turn the tide on this one.” To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Bykowicz in Washington at  jbykowicz@bloomberg.net ; Jonathan D.

{"headline": "Emerging Markets Gain Clout at IMF Amid Faster Growth Trends", "article": "The clout of emerging markets at the International Monetary Fund is rising as faster economic growth from China to India in the past few years would boost their voting power, data released by the fund show. The calculated quota share of emerging and developing economies increased to 45.3 percent in 2011 from 43.9 percent in 2010 and 41.8 percent in 2008, according to a report released today and discussed by the board last month. The share for advanced economies fell to 54.7 percent from 56.1 percent. Most of the increase is linked to the countries’ gross domestic product, “reflecting a continued marked divergence in growth trends,” between developed and developing countries, according to the staff report. Among emerging countries, “the largest gains continue to be recorded by Asia while most other regions register modest increases.” The changes mirror a shift in the balance of economic power that saw developed economies struggling to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 while their emerging counterparts helped sustain global growth. IMF quotas help determine how much a country can borrow and its voting share at the IMF. Calculated with a formula that uses GDP as one of four components, they have been a point of discord between groups of countries as emerging markets demand more say at the institution. Paulo Nogueira Batista, who represents Brazil and 10 other countries at the IMF board, said in an e-mailed statement that the formula needs to change. “We remain of the view -- and have not found reasons to revise our position -- that to honor” commitments by the Group of 20 nations and the IMF’s steering committee, “the revised quota formula would need to be based essentially” on a GDP variable with more weight on purchasing power parity, he said. A 2010 agreement boosting the share of developing countries has not yet come into force, pending approval by the U.S. Congress. Fund members are trying to reach a new quota agreement by early next year.

{"headline": "Hutchin Hill Credit Trader Ahmad Said to Leave, Unwind Positions", "article": "Shahraab Ahmad, a credit trader at Hutchin Hill Capital LP who joined the firm at its 2008 inception, is leaving and has mostly completed liquidating his $150 million book. The 37-year-old money manager “has decided that he intends to retire,” New York-based Hutchin Hill said today in a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg News. “We are parting amicably, we thank Shahraab for his many contributions to the firm and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.” Ahmad and his traders began selling positions in corporate bonds and credit-default swaps in May at the $1.1 billion firm founded by Neil Chriss, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. The hedge fund had sought investors last year for the Hutchin Hill Liquid Credit Master Fund Ltd. that Ahmad was managing, two of the people said. The private swaps market has been shrinking as U.S. rules that seek to curb risk and increase transparency take effect. Mandatory clearing of swaps, in which contracts are processed through clearinghouses and backed by collateral, began in March. A second phase requiring that users including hedge funds start clearing will begin June 10. Ahmad didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment on his departure. Nathaniel Garnick, a spokesman for Hutchin Hill at Sard Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment. Mark Meenan, a portfolio manager who joined the firm from Anchorage Capital Group LLC, will continue to oversee credit trading for the $1 billion Diversified Alpha Master Fund, Hutchin Hill said in the letter. Exceptional Trader Fortune named Ahmad one of Wall Street’s top traders in 2011. The magazine called him an “exceptional credit trader” and quoted an unnamed person who compared his talent with SAC Capital Advisors LP’s Steven A. Cohen. Ahmad was a money manager at Stamford , Connecticut-based hedge fund Sailfish Capital Partners LP from 2005 through 2007. Earlier, he worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Hutchin Hill has jumped 10.11 percent this year through the end of May, according to a person briefed on its returns. Chriss, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader who later managed a portfolio at SAC Capital, started the fund with $300 million from Renaissance Technologies Corp. founder James Simons. “My strategy does really well in environments where spreads are really wide, when you can find opportunities at distressed valuations, or where spreads are very narrow in which case you get to short opportunities at great valuations,” Ahmad said in a February interview with Bloomberg Brief. “Now I think we’re in sort of a middle environment.” Spreads Tighten The extra yield investors demand to hold speculative-grade bonds rather than similar-maturity Treasuries reached 423 basis points last month, the least in more than five years, before climbing to 508 yesterday, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index. Spreads on the debt, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s , have tightened from a record 2,182 basis points in December 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 sought to regulate the financial industry after the credit crisis that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and a U.S. rescue of American International Group Inc.

Onyx jumped 6.5 percent in early U.S. trading. Under the agreement reached yesterday, Bayer will pay Onyx a 20 percent royalty on worldwide sales of regorafenib for use in oncology, South San Francisco-based Onyx said today in a regulatory filing.

{"headline": "Iran Warns Against International Military Intervention in Syria", "article": "Iran ’s foreign Ministry warned against any international military action in Syria , its long-time ally, saying that intervention would heighten regional tensions. “There are no international authorizations for a military intervention in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying today by the state-run Iranian Students' News Agency. “We warn against any moves or announcements that would result in further tensions in the region.” Araghchi also questioned claims that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government used chemical weapons in an attack opposition groups say killed 1,300 people, saying “evidence” pointed to the fact that it had been carried out by “terrorist groups” with the aim to implicate the Syrian government. “The fact that they were used while UN inspectors were present is a sign that some hands are at work to accuse the Syrian government,” he said. U.S. President Barack Obama is coming under increased pressure to intervene in Syria amid allegations of chemical arms use by Assad. In comments to reporters yesterday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated that U.S. military forces, including naval vessels, are positioned in the Mediterranean and ready to act if the president calls on the Pentagon to strike at Syria. “Provocative opinions by U.S. military officials or moves such as positioning war ships won’t help resolve the issue and will only endanger further the situation in the region,” Araghchi said.

{"headline": "Fiat Raises 2010 Forecasts on Tractors, Trucks Sales", "article": "Fiat SpA raised its 2010 forecasts after quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates on sales of Iveco trucks and Case New Holland tractors. The shares jumped to the highest level in more than two years in Milan. Full-year earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items will be at least 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion), from a previous target of as much as 1.2 billion euros, the Turin, Italy-based carmaker said today. Third-quarter net income reached 170 million euros, surpassing the 42 million-euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne , who also runs Chrysler Group LLC, is spinning off Fiat’s industrial units to focus on reviving carmaking operations. Italy’s largest manufacturer led a sixth consecutive monthly decline in European car sales in September as demand wanes after government incentives expired, industry figures showed. “Results delivered by the auto business are better than expected,” said Erich Hauser , an analyst at Credit Suisse. “Despite a decline in unit sales, Fiat managed to show flat year on year revenue, helped by an exchange rate that favored Fiat in Brazil.” Two-Year High Fiat rose 52 cents, or 4.4 percent, to 12.24 euros, the highest price since June 2008, in Milan trading. The stock has advanced 19 percent this year, compared with a 22 percent gain in PSA Peugeot Citroen and a 44 percent advance in Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest carmaker. Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time gains or losses, which Fiat calls trading profit, rose 90 percent to 586 million euros, topping the 409 million-euro average estimate of analysts. Nine-month trading profit more than doubled to 1.59 billion euros. Full-year sales will top 55 billion euros from an earlier forecast of more than 50 billion euros, Fiat said today. Third- quarter revenue climbed 12 percent to 13.5 billion euros. Full- year net income will be about 400 million euros instead of an earlier projection for break-even, Fiat said. Group sales may increase to 59 billion euros and trading profit to as much as 2.6 billion euros in 2011, according to the company’s business presentation in April. “Our view on 2011 hasn’t changed since,” Marchionne said today on a conference call with analysts. Fiat will update its 2011 targets in January, he said. Incentives Expire Auto sales in Italy in the first quarter of 2011 will be worse than the same period in 2010, just before government incentives in Italy for scrapping old cars for more fuel efficient vehicles expired, Marchionne said today, without giving numbers. The carving out of operations including Iveco and CNH Global NV into Fiat Industrial SpA will give Marchionne two entities to facilitate future alliances. Fiat plans to list Fiat Industrial shares on the Milan exchange Jan. 3. “Investors are more focused on the spinoff,” said Wolfram Mrowetz , who oversees 200 million euros including Fiat shares as chairman of Alisei SIM in Milan. “Fiat is a stock to have in your portfolio before the split, which will unveil the real value of the two units and may lead to mergers and acquisitions.” Chrysler Stake Fiat, which acquired a 20 percent stake in Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler last year, expects to raise the holding to 25 percent by the first quarter and to 35 percent by the end of next year. Marchionne plans to take the automaker public, probably in the second half of 2011, he said last month. Fiat is “no position” now to decide on an option to acquire a further 16 percent in the U.S. carmaker after the holding rises to 35 percent, Marchionne said. The CEO reiterated that the Alfa Romeo unit isn’t for sale and may become a “premium brand” helped by the integration with Chrysler. “If someone will show up with a number which is by definition outside the boundaries of what we consider achievable outcomes, Fiat will have to take a hard look,” he said. Volkswagen AG, Europe’s largest carmaker, is interested in buying Alfa, supervisory board Chairman Ferdinand Piech said last month. Fiat’s net industrial debt rose 7 percent in the third quarter to 3.97 billion euros. The Italian carmaker cut its debt target for end of the year to less than 4 billion euros from more than 5 billion euros. Fabbrica Italia Marchionne wants to boost efficiency at Fiat’s less productive domestic plants, in exchange for shifting production of its Panda model from Poland to Pomigliano. Fiat plans to invest 20 billion euros through 2014 in Italy to improve plants and vehicle development if unions agree to curb strikes and add shifts. “Fiat shares are appealing as the auto sector is reporting better than expected” results, said Emanuele Oggioni , who manages 650 million euros including Fiat stock at Saint George Capital Management in Lugano, Switzerland. Third-quarter deliveries in Europe declined 25 percent to 197,800 vehicles, according to Fiat. The company’s passenger-car sales worldwide slumped 16 percent to 391,400 cars.

{"headline": "Ukrainian Parliament Standoff Extends Into Second Week on Voting", "article": "Ukrainian opposition parties blocked Parliament for a second week to protest lawmakers who vote on behalf of absent colleagues, prompting threats that President Viktor Yanukovych may dissolve the legislature. Jailed ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko ’s party, world boxing champion Vitali Klitschko ’s UDAR and the right-wing Svoboda surrounded the speaker’s rostrum today in the capital, Kiev. UDAR lawmakers have stayed in Parliament since Feb. 5, including at night, attaching stickers saying “vote for yourself” to the seats of pro-presidential deputies. Yanukovych may exercise his right to dissolve Parliament if it fails to function for 30 days, Vitaliy Zhuravskyi, a member of the president’s Party of Regions, said today on parliamentary TV channel Rada. Klitschko called the threat a “bluff,” according to a statement on his website. Yanukovych’s spokeswoman, Darka Chepak, couldn’t comment immediately when called by Bloomberg. While the Party of Regions got more votes than its rivals in Oct. 28 elections, it fell short of a majority and relies on support from the Communists and independent lawmakers to pass legislation. Opposition parties, which boosted their number of seats, are demanding technological changes to the existing parliamentary voting system to stop absent lawmakers’ identification cards being used to submit ballots.

Shares of Shinsei Bank partly owned by J. Christopher Flowers rose as much as 6.7 percent to 95 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of 9:26 a.m., the biggest gain since March 1. Aozora Bank, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, climbed 2.8 percent to 182 yen. Income from selling assets including foreign stocks, coupled with fewer credit costs and operating expenses boosted Shinsei Bank’s net income by 31 percent to 18.2 billion yen ($234 million) in the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, it said in an exchange filing yesterday. Japan ’s bank lending decline slowed in June falling 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the smallest drop in 19 months, according to Bank of Japan data. Shinsei Chief Executive Officer Shigeki Toma plans to expand consumer financing including uncollateralized loans given that signs of recovery in the country’s lending demand are emerging, he said in the statement.

{"headline": "Masisa Tumbles as Top Market Venezuela Devalues Currency", "article": "Masisa SA , a Chilean wood panels manufacturer that gets a quarter of its revenue from Venezuela, tumbled the most in three months on speculation that a devaluation of the country’s currency will crimp profits. Masisa fell 3.3 percent to 54.5 pesos at 1:33 p.m. in Santiago trading after earlier falling as much as 4.2 percent in the biggest intraday loss since Oct. 19. It was the biggest decliner today on the Chile 65 stock-market index , which tracks the country’s largest companies based on an adjusted measure of market value. Venezuela’s finance minister said Feb. 8 the government would weaken the official exchange rate by 32 percent to 6.3 bolivars per dollar. The country accounted for 25 percent of Santiago-based Masisa’s revenue during the first nine months of 2012, according to regulatory filings. “They will have a lot of revenue in bolivars and to bring that back in dollars will cost more,” Jose Manuel Edwards , an analyst at Santiago-based broker IM Trust SA, said in a telephone interview. Masisa operates 38 Placacentro construction-material stores in Venezuela, according to the company’s website. Masisa also has an industrial facility and owns 84,800 hectares of forests in the country.

{"headline": "India Winter Oilseed Output May Gain as High Prices Spur Mustard Planting", "article": "India’s winter-sown oilseed harvest may top last year’s output as higher prices encouraged farmers to increase mustard planting and as favorable weather boosts yields, according to the Solvent Extractors’ Association Ltd. Output for the crop, harvesting for which starts in March, may be more than the 9.27 million metric tons likely produced a year earlier, B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association, which represents 800 Indian oilseed processors, said in an interview yesterday. A bigger crop may cut vegetable oil purchases by India, the world’s largest buyer after China. India relies on overseas supplies to meet more than half of its edible oil demand and palm oil makes up almost 80 percent of the nation’s imports. “International prices have gone up and local prices have moved in tandem with them. This will have direct impact on domestic oilseeds prices and will ensure better return for the farmers,” Mehta said by telephone from Mumbai. “Farmers expect they will get a better price” for winter-sown oilseeds. Palm oil futures on Dec. 28 gained to 3,792 ringgit ($1,231) a ton, the highest level since March 2008, amid concern that the supply of cooking oils may tighten as dry weather in Argentina hurt the crop in the world’s largest producer of soybean oil, and after rains affected harvesting in Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest exporters of palm oil. The most-active contract in Malaysia rose 42 percent this year, the second straight annual increase, and ended at the highest since at least 1995, according to Bloomberg data. Prices Rise Refined soybean oil for January delivery has risen 20 percent since Oct. 12 on the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange while crude palm oil has increased 30 percent since Oct. 18 on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India in Mumbai. Mustard seed, planted in October and November, accounts for more than 70 percent of India’s output of winter oilseeds. Its yellow-colored oil is the third-most used cooking oil in India after palm oil and soybean oil. Winter-sown oilseeds, including mustard and peanuts, were planted on 8.45 million hectares (20.8 million acres) as of Dec. 24, up from 8.24 million hectares a year ago, the farm ministry said last week. “Based on the acreage if everything remains normal we will have a better crop than last year,” Mehta said. “Favorable weather” is also supporting crops as late monsoon rains improved the soil moisture, Mehta said. India purchases palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil. To contact the reporter on this story: Pratik Parija in New Delhi at  pparija@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Schleck’s Positive Drug Test Is Confirmed by Second Analysis", "article": "A backup drug test on Tour de France rider Frank Schleck confirmed a positive finding for a banned diuretic, cycling’s ruling body said in a release. Luxembourg’s Schleck quit the Tour three days ago in the second drug scandal to hit the race in a week. Schleck, third in the event last year, was found to have Xipamide in a urine sample, said the International Cycling Union, known as the UCI. The result was confirmed by analysis of the B sample, the UCI added today in an e-mailed statement. The diuretic can be used as a masking agent for performance- enhancing drugs. “The analysis of the sample B of Frank Schleck’s urine carried out today has confirmed the result of the adverse analytical finding,” the UCI said. “In accordance with the anti-doping rules, the UCI will request the Luxembourg Federation to open a disciplinary procedure against the rider.” Schleck has denied taking any banned substance, saying he could have been the victim of poisoning. He repeated his denial of wrongdoing after the latest test, Agence France-Presse reported. “The result of the counter-test was positive but for me nothing changes, I just know that I did nothing wrong,” he was cited as saying by AFP. “I will therefore continue my search to find out how the substance could have entered my body.” Even though UCI rules don’t mandate an automatic suspension for the drug in Schleck’s sample, the rider and his RadioShack- Nissan-Trek team agreed that he should withdraw from the Tour. Another rider, Remy di Gregorio, was suspended by the Cofidis team on July 10 as it investigates whether the French cyclist tried to take performance-enhancing drugs. He also denied wrongdoing. Latest Setback Schleck’s positive test is the latest setback for the RadioShack squad. Manager Johan Bruyneel is sitting out the race after being accused of overseeing doping on the U.S. Postal Service team that was led by Lance Armstrong. Bruyneel denies the charge by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and has asked for his case to be heard by an arbitration panel. The Tour ends July 22 in Paris, with Bradley Wiggins leading by 2 minutes, 5 seconds and poised to become the first British winner of the event.

{"headline": "Live Nation Profit Climbs 12% on Concert Business Growth", "article": "Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the world’s biggest concert promoter, said third-quarter profit increased 12 percent on growth in ticketing, talent management and sponsorship. Net income grew to $57.9 million, or 31 cents a share, from $51.7 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, Beverly Hills , California-based Live Nation said yesterday in a statement. Sales gained 9.7 percent to $1.96 billion, exceeding the $1.82 billion average of four analysts’ estimates. Live Nation is revamping Ticketmaster, adding territories outside the U.S. and expanding its roster of concert festivals to boost operating income 35 percent through 2015, Chief Executive Officer Michael Rapino told investors last month. The company expects growth in concerts, ticketing and sponsorship in the current quarter. The company has sold 3 million tickets for events in the year ahead, compared with 900,000 a year ago. “The more popular my concert business, even though it’s the least profitable in terms of margins, the more we make on ticketing and sponsorship,” Rapino said in an interview. “It’s the engine that drives our global platform.” Pink, Rihanna and other performers are selling tickets earlier, giving the company more time to market shows, Rapino said. With more tickets sold in advance, managers of other acts gain confidence to tour, he said. Thinking Ahead “We like that artists are thinking about 2013 in September,” Rapino said. “We usually aren’t putting these on sale until February or March. It doesn’t effect later business, we won’t see any decline next year.” Adjusted operating income of $202.4 million beat the $192.7 million average of estimates. Adjusted operating income excludes acquisition costs related to the 2010 purchase of Ticketmaster, asset sales, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Live Nation fell 0.8 percent to $9.17 yesterday in New York and has gained 10 percent this year. The company held 5,182 events that drew 11.5 million attendees in North America and 4.27 million elsewhere, with worldwide attendance up 1.6 percent, according to the statement. North American spending per attendee rose to $18.55 in the period from $18.03 a year earlier, the company said. International festival goers spent an average $15.71 each, up from $16.80 a year earlier. Live Nation sold 36.1 million tickets valued at $2.1 billion in the period, compared with 34.9 million tickets worth $2 billion a year earlier.

{"headline": "China VP Xi’s Absence From Public Fuels Speculation", "article": "Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping ’s absence from public events for more than a week fueled speculation about the health of the leading candidate to succeed President Hu Jintao in a once-in-a-decade leadership change. Since speaking at the Party School of the Communist Party on Sept. 1, Xi canceled a Sept. 5 meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After foreign journalists in Beijing were told the same day that Xi would meet Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt on Sept. 10, the event wasn’t included in an official agenda distributed Sept. 7. The foreign ministry said yesterday no such meeting was planned. Related:  Xi Jinping Millionaire Relations Reveal Fortunes of Elite Secrecy surrounding China ’s leadership, combined with the ouster of Politburo member Bo Xilai earlier this year, has left investors with limited information on who’ll be overseeing the world’s second-biggest economy. The Communist Party has yet to release the dates for the gathering anticipated in coming weeks where the next generation of policy makers will be appointed. “China is the second-largest economy in the world and Beijing is one of the central stages of international diplomacy,” said Yawei Liu , director of the China Program at the Atlanta-based Carter Center. “Open government information is absolutely crucial for the government to maintain political stability. The lack of transparency will weaken the wobbling legitimacy even more.” Shanghai Composite The Shanghai Composite Index has risen 3.8 percent since Sept. 5, the day Xi and Clinton were supposed to meet. The cost of insuring Chinese sovereign bonds against default fell to the lowest in more than a year yesterday, according to data provider CMA. The Clinton meeting was canceled after Xi injured his back, the Wall Street Journal reported Sept. 5, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The cancellation was a “normal adjustment,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Sept. 5. Asked four times about Xi at a briefing today, Hong said he had no information about the vice president’s health and declined to give details about his whereabouts. “I hope you will raise some serious questions,” Hong said. “Next question.” ‘Timely Introduction’ In his last public appearance, at the Party School, Xi urged cadres to “constantly absorb new knowledge” to improve their level of leadership. “We must firmly establish the correct view of the world, power and career, and develop a broad mind and vision, noble interests, and a plain style of living, and always be the loyal public servants of the people,” Xi said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Other Chinese leaders have continued to make public appearances. Hu attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok, Russia , over the weekend and Premier Wen Jiabao was scheduled to speak today at the World Economic Forum ’s conference in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. A week after the ouster of Bo as party chief of the municipality of Chongqing, speculation of a coup spread on the Internet, helping spark the biggest jump in credit-default swaps on Chinese government bonds in four months. Six people accused of spreading the coup rumors were later detained. Bo, once seen as a candidate for inclusion in the new leadership group to be appointed this year, was suspended from the Politburo in April for “serious violations of discipline,” according to Xinhua.

{"headline": "Obama Rejects Speculation Summers Has Fed ‘Inside Track’", "article": "President Barack Obama rejected the notion that Lawrence Summers is the front-runner to replace Federal Reserve Chairmen Ben S. Bernanke , explaining that he has defended his former National Economic Council director as an act of loyalty. “The perception that Mr. Summers might have an inside track simply had to do with a bunch of attacks that I was hearing on Mr. Summers pre-emptively, which is sort of a standard Washington exercise that I don’t like,” Obama said at a White House news conference yesterday. “I tend to defend folks who I think have done a good job and don’t deserve attacks.” The former Treasury secretary is one of a “range of outstanding candidates” to head lead the central bank, including Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen , the president said. While Obama didn’t express a preference between Summers and Yellen, calling them both “outstanding candidates,” he did elaborate on the need for the next Fed chairman to combat inflation. The president warned of the potential dangers of “artificial bubbles” and reiterated his requirement that the next chairman work to lower unemployment. “My main criteria for the Fed Reserve chairman is somebody who understands they’ve got a dual mandate,” he said. “A critical part of the job is making sure that we keep inflation in check, that our monetary policy is sound, that the dollar is sound.” Additional Candidates Besides Summers, 58, and Yellen, 66, Obama said he had a “couple” more candidates under consideration. Last week, he told House lawmakers that he was also considering former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn , 70, for the job, bringing to three the names of publicly known candidates. It’s hard to make a case that Summers, Yellen or Kohn “clearly has a stronger reputation than the others” on inflation, said Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC in Jersey City , New Jersey. “Proponents of each individual might make subjective arguments on their favorite’s behalf.’ ‘‘Of the three, Yellen is probably seen as the most focused on unemployment (USURTOT) issues,” he said. “The common perception would probably be that Summers and Kohn have more experience with the financial bubble issues that the president cited.” Obama, 52, told House lawmakers last week that Summers was being unfairly criticized. Yesterday, he compared Summers to his National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Obama didn’t nominate her for Secretary of State after a backlash over statements she made following the attacks in Benghazi, Libya , last September. Rice Comparison “When somebody’s worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see him getting slapped around in the press for no reason before they’ve even been nominated for anything, then I want to make sure that somebody’s standing up for them,” Obama said. “I felt the same way when people were attacking Susan Rice before she was nominated for anything.” Obama ultimately picked former Massachusetts Senator John Kerry instead of Rice as the nation’s top diplomat and moved her to a post that doesn’t require Senate confirmation. For the Fed position, Obama said he’ll make a decision “in the fall” on a replacement forBernanke, 59, whose term expires on Jan. 31. Yellen has been the Fed vice chairman since October 2010. Summers, who was Treasury secretary from July 1999 to January 2001, returned to government in 2009 to serve as National Economic Council director during Obama’s first term. Sticky Wicket “Obama is on a sticky wicket at this stage,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who worked at the Fed’s division of monetary affairs from 2004 until 2008. “If he appoints Summers, he upsets many people in his party. If he appoints Yellen, he seems to have backed down under pressure.” “So he is surely at least thinking about other alternatives, and not just Don Kohn,” he said. “One way out might be to persuade Ben Bernanke to stay for another term after all.” After warning about the need to preserve a strong dollar, Obama elaborated on the other aspect of the Fed’s dual mandate. “If you look at the biggest challenges we have, the challenge is not inflation,” he said. “The challenge is we’ve still got too many people out of work, too many long-term unemployed, too much slack in -- in the economy, and we’re not growing as fast as we should.” Missed Targets The Fed has been missing on both targets of its twin goals. The personal consumption expenditures index -- the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation -- rose 1.3 percent in June from a year earlier, below the central bank’s 2 percent goal. Unemployment, at 7.4 percent in July, has been above 7 percent since November 2008. Employers added 162,000 workers in July, the least in four months and following a revised 188,000 rise in June that was less than initially estimated. While the unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent, policy makers have expressed concern that discouraged workers were dropping out of the labor force and others have been unable to find work for an extended period. The labor market is “far from satisfactory, as the unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run normal level, and rates of underemployment and long- term unemployment are still much too high,” Bernanke told Congress July 17. While Bernanke hasn’t said whether he’d be willing to stay for a third term, Obama indicated in a June interview with Charlie Rose that the Fed chief had stayed in the post “longer than he wanted.” To contact the reporters on this story: Hans Nichols in Washington at  hnichols2@bloomberg.net ; Michelle Jamrisko in Washington at  mjamrisko@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at  skomarow1@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "연방준비제도(Fed) 의장의 이중 임무란 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "연방준비제도(Fed) 의장의 인플레이션 관리와 실업률 감소의 균형은 어떻게 이루어져야 하는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "연방준비제도(Fed) 의장의 임명과 관련된 정치적 고려사항과 그 영향은 무엇인가?"}]}
{"headline": "Lew Says Debt-Limit Fight Hurt Economy and Can’t Be Repeated", "article": "Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the political drama surrounding the debt limit hurt the U.S. economy and must not be repeated. “We need to make sure that government does not go through another round of brinkmanship,” Lew said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program airing today. “This can never happen again.” Even getting close to the breaching the debt ceiling “does do some damage,” Lew said. “But we have a resilient economy.” President Barack Obama signed legislation Oct. 17, the day Lew said the U.S. would exhaust its borrowing authority, to suspend the debt ceiling until Feb. 7 and end a 16-day partial government shutdown. The 11th-hour deal between Democrats and House Republicans sets the stage for another possible showdown early next year. “What we just went through was a political crisis, not an economic crisis,” Lew said. “This one was a little bit scary because it got so close to the edge.” The government closing shaved at least 0.6 percent from U.S. fourth-quarter gross-domestic-product growth, Standard & Poor’s said in a report Oct. 16. Americans in October were the most pessimistic about the nation’s economic prospects in almost two years, as concern mounted that the political gridlock in Washington would hurt the expansion, according to the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index of expectations. Fiscal Health As Congress hashes out a budget agreement in the wake of the shutdown, it should focus on accelerating economic growth and can build on progress already made in lowering U.S. budget deficits, Lew wrote in an opinion piece published in the New York Times today. “This is an opportunity to improve our nation’s long-term fiscal health,” Lew wrote, advocating “a comprehensive package that shrinks our deficits, protects Medicare and Social Security for those who rely on it, and expands our economy well into the future.” Lew, who as Treasury secretary oversees U.S. economic sanctions, told NBC it’s “premature to be talking” about easing measures targeting Iran. “We need to see that they’re taking the steps to move away from having nuclear weapons capacity,” he said. “We need to see real, tangible evidence of it, and that we will not make moves in the sanctions until we see those kinds of moves.” Iran Sanctions Iran is calling on the U.S. and European Union to ease sanctions that have battered its economy. The Western powers are demanding curbs on Iran’s nuclear work, which they say may be a cover for a weapons program. Iran says it has a right to enrich uranium and is interested only in using nuclear technology for peaceful, civilian purposes. President Hassan Rouhani’s phone call with Obama last month raised expectations of a compromise that would avert the risk of armed conflict over the issue. The U.S. and Israel say they’re ready to use force if diplomacy doesn’t work. Lew also said he’s confident Obama’s health-care law will be on track to ensure that people who need coverage can get it. “The huge outpouring of interest shows how important it is that we get this right,” Lew said. “There’s no one more frustrated than the president at the difficulty in the website.’ To contact the reporter on this story: Ian Katz in Washington at  ikatz2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미국 정부의 부채 한도 위기가 경제에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미국 정부의 부채 한도 위기가 장기적인 재정 건전성에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "미국 정부의 부채 한도 위기와 이란 경제 제재가 글로벌 금융 시장에 미치는 상호 연관된 영향은 무엇인가?"}]}
{"headline": "Red Sox Beat Yankees 8-7 on Napoli’s Home Run in 11th Inning", "article": "Mike Napoli belted a solo home run with two outs in the bottom of the 11th inning to lift the Boston Red Sox to an 8-7 win over the New York Yankees and a third series win against their division rivals this season. Napoli’s second homer of the Major League Baseball game gave the Red Sox the victory just before 1 a.m. today at Fenway Park in Boston, where his teammates raced out of the dugout to celebrate as he crossed home plate. Boston won two of three games in the series and has taken six of nine meetings between the clubs this season. “I knew one swing could do it and I got a pitch I could drive,” Napoli, who finished with four runs batted in, said in a televised interview. “It was a great series win for us.” The Red Sox improved to 60-40 and stayed 1 1/2 games ahead of the Tampa Bay Rays atop the American League Eastern Division. The Rays won for the 13th time in 14 games yesterday by holding on for a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. The Red Sox and Rays open a four-game series in Boston today. Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia allowed seven earned runs on his 33rd birthday as the Red Sox opened a 7-3 lead last night. The left-hander has now given up 15 earned runs in his past two starts. Sabathia surrendered a three-run homer to Napoli in the third inning that put Boston ahead 4-3 and also gave up a towering home run to Jonny Gomes in the fifth. The Yankees scored two runs in both the sixth and seventh innings to tie the game and force extra innings. 423-Foot Homer In the bottom of the 11th, Yankees reliever Adam Warren retired the first two batters before Napoli blasted a 423-foot (129-meter) home run into the second row of seats in center field on a full-count fastball. It was the ninth time this season the Red Sox won a game in their final at-bat. Also yesterday, Matt Harvey had 10 strikeouts over seven scoreless innings in his first start since the All-Star Game as the New York Mets shut out the Philadelphia Phillies 5-0, while pitchers Adam Wainwright and Bartolo Colon each picked up their 13th wins of the season, tied for the most in the majors. Wainwright allowed two runs over eight innings in the St. Louis Cardinals’ 3-2 win against the San Diego Padres and Colon tossed a four-hit shutout as the Oakland Athletics blanked the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-0.

{"headline": "U.S. Company Credit Risk Gauge Falls From Worst Since June 2010", "article": "A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk fell from the highest level since June 2010 as investors weighed what the Federal Reserve will do to bolster the faltering economy. The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 1 basis point to a mid- price of 125 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. The cost to protect Bank of America Corp. (BAC) debt for five years fell from the highest level since April 2009, while contracts for one year jumped. The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates, had soared to as high as 129.6 basis points from 96.3 at the end of last month as concern mounts that the global economic recovery is fading and as Europe ’s sovereign crisis spreads. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole , Wyoming, as U.S. unemployment holds above 9 percent. “You do have a number of potential policy headline events that could stem the tide” of negative sentiment, said Rizwan Hussain , a credit strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Contracts protecting against a default by Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America dropped 12 basis points to 372.6 basis points, according to data provider CMA. That means it would cost $372,600 annually to protect $10 million of the debt for five years. Swaps protecting the debt against losses for one year jumped 24.4 basis points to 460, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. An inverted curve signals traders are pricing in a greater probability of credit deteriorating in the shorter term. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.

{"headline": "Bankrupt Alabama County Reaches New Accord With Creditors", "article": "Commissioners in Alabama ’s Jefferson County approved a deal with creditors, including $100 million in new concessions from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , that may allow the county to end its two-year bankruptcy. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, took the lead in arranging risky securities deals that pushed the county into bankruptcy in 2011. The bank had already agreed to forgive $842 million of the $1.22 billion it was owed. Under the debt-reduction settlement, bond insurers agreed to $40 million in additional concessions; hedge funds , $17.5 million; and liquidity banks, $2.8 million. JPMorgan additionally pledged to provide a 40-year letter of credit up to $180 million, commissioners were told. “We now have a clear path out of bankruptcy,” commission President David Carrington said yesterday after the panel voted to accept the agreement. Finance Chairman Jimmie Stephens called the plan less than ideal, but the best the county could do. “It’s confirmable, feasible and sustainable,” Stephens said in an interview in Birmingham. A JPMorgan spokesman, Justin Perras , said the company would have no comment. The agreement replaces a deal reached in June that became unworkable due to rising interest rates. It would have left the county about $350 million short of what it needed to exit bankruptcy. The earlier deal provided $1.84 billion in cash to settle about $3 billion in sewer debt, tied to a bankruptcy-exit plan. Biggest Bankruptcy Jefferson County became what was then the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in 2011 when it couldn’t pay what it owed on the sewer bonds. The sewer project was tainted by political corruption and by risky refinancing methods. JPMorgan agreed in a 2009 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to pay the county $75 million and give up more than $657 million in swaps claims. The hedge funds include Brigade Capital Management LLC, Claren Road Asset Management LLC, Fundamental Advisors LP, all based in New York , and Monarch Capital Master Partners LP, according to court records. Insurers, including Assured Guaranty (AGO) Municipal, Syncora Guarantee and Financial Guaranty Insurance, were to get $165 million under the earlier agreement. They said they were owed $315 million. ‘Integral Part’ “ Assured Guaranty has been an integral part of the solution by helping to facilitate a viable bankruptcy exit plan,” Chief Executive Officer Dominic Frederico said in a statement. Assured will insure $500 million in new Jefferson County debt under the agreement, according to the statement. Syncora doesn’t comment on matters being litigated, Managing Director Michael Corbally said by e-mail. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Bennett is scheduled to consider approving the bankruptcy-exit plan next month at a hearing in Birmingham.

{"headline": "Moody’s, S&P Caved In to Ratings Pressure From Goldman, UBS Over Mortgages", "article": "Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s adjusted the way they graded securities after Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and at least six more banks pressured them, according to a U.S. Senate report. The world’s two largest bond-ranking companies, both based in New York, made exceptions to rules when bankers asked for better safety ratings on complex mortgage-backed securities, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said yesterday. When Moody’s and S&P changed their assessments of hundreds of those bonds in July 2007, it helped trigger the financial crisis, the panel said. “The ratings agencies weakened their standards as each competed to provide the most favorable rating to win business and greater market share,” according to the report. “The result was a race to the bottom.” The conclusions cap a two-year investigation into the financial crisis during which senators questioned executives about the failings of Wall Street banks, regulators and mortgage companies. In a televised hearing last year, lawmakers compared Goldman Sachs bankers to bookies and subcommittee Chairman Carl M. Levin grilled them about marketing securities. Levin’s committee wants regulators to eliminate rules shielding Moody’s and S&P from being sued over flawed ratings and publish accuracy rankings for the companies. ‘Key Enablers’ Levin and Republican Senator Tom A. Coburn of Oklahoma held four public hearings in 2010. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission also looked into the role of ratings companies, calling them “key enablers of the financial meltdown” in its January report. Relying on mathematical models, Moody’s and S&P awarded AAA ratings to mortgage securities packaged during the five-year housing boom, deeming them as safe as government bonds. About 90 percent of AAA securities backed by subprime mortgages from 2006 and 2007 were later downgraded to junk status, Levin’s committee said. Such revisions forced banks, pension funds and insurance companies to sell holdings, contributing to $2 trillion in losses and asset-writedowns worldwide. S&P Rejects Responsibility Lower ratings “reflected the unprecedented deterioration in credit quality , but were not a cause of it,” Catherine Mathis, an S&P spokeswoman, said in an e-mail response to Levin’s findings. “We regret that, like many others, we did not foresee the speed and extent of the housing downturn, which was the steepest decline since the Great Depression.” Michael Adler , a Moody’s spokesman who hadn’t seen the Levin report, declined to comment. Moody’s gross revenue from rating the complex products quadrupled to $260 million in 2006 from $61 million in 2002, according to the congressional report. For S&P, the number also quadrupled to $265 million in 2006 from $64 million in 2002. “Investment bankers who complained about rating methodologies, criteria, or decisions were often able to obtain exceptions or other favorable treatment,” according to the Levin report. The decisions appeared to be “concessions made to prevent the loss of business.” Eight Banks Cited The subcommittee released e-mails showing UBS, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citigroup Inc., Bear Stearns Cos., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. all pressured the ratings companies to loosen standards for assessing certain securities or make exceptions. UBS told S&P that grading securities the bank was selling more conservatively might shift business to Moody’s and competitor Fitch Ratings, according to Levin’s findings. In another case, a Goldman Sachs banker objected to a rating decision S&P made on a collateralized-debt obligation called Abacus 2006-12, according to an e-mail released by the panel. S&P director Chris Meyer at first “pushed back” then “suggested an exception could be made if it were limited to the CDO at hand,” the committee said. Lucas van Praag, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs in New York , declined to comment. UBS, JPMorgan Moody’s made concessions in 2007 when it rated a deal called Lancer II for UBS and exceptions for three Bear Stearns deals in 2006, according to the report. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in 2008 as the company teetered on the brink of collapse. Robert Miller of JPMorgan complained in 2007 that Moody’s was planning to give a deal a lower rating than S&P. “There’s going to be a three notch difference when we print the deal if it goes out as is,” Miller wrote in an e-mail to Moody’s Mark DiRienz. “I’m already having agita about the investor calls I’m going to get.” DiRienz replied that an analyst “is looking into some adjustments to his methodology that should be a benefit to you folks.” Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment before seeing the report, as did UBS spokeswoman Kelly Smith. Flawed Fees Levin, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the ratings providers’ business model of collecting fees from the companies whose deal they rate, comparing the practice to “one of the parties in court paying the judge’s salary.” Ray McDaniel, Moody’s chairman and chief executive officer, told the panel those potential conflicts are well-managed. “We, like many others, did not anticipate the unprecedented confluence of forces that drove the unusually poor performance of subprime mortgages in the past several years,” McDaniel said in prepared testimony.

{"headline": "Is it Time for Mutiny?", "article": "Perhaps you have dreamed of mutiny. Perhaps you serve under a boss whose grasp of what is important to the organization's success and how to achieve it is so shaky that he or she should be dispatched as an incompetent. Or maybe that leader's treatment of subordinates is so uncaring as to be abusive. If the situation is so bad that you are actually plotting the insurrection, it's a good moment to ask: When do mutinies actually succeed? We actually know the answer to that question, from the people who did mutiny best: seafarers in the Age of Discovery. My colleague Ray Coye and I spent four years mining obscure primary-source accounts and journals from the era from the mid-1400s to the early 1600s to write Mutiny and Its Bounty. This was the time when seafarers like Vasco da Gama, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, and Henry Hudson undertook risky ventures at sea. Their venturing began in Portugal and Spain and went on for hundreds of years and with staggering volume. It's a rarely studied era, but it holds deep lessons in human enterprise — even more, in many respects, than the study of modern industrial organizations. Mutinies were as common as the wind on Age of Discovery seafaring ventures. What's more, the people participating in them often had very sophisticated conceptualizations of leadership and service. They also recorded firsthand much of what happened. Our analysis of records and diaries from their long enterprises shows that mutinies are successfully carried out when a few conditions are present: Put all this together and you have a situation where an influential member is able to make the case that the current leader can't be trusted to deal with new threats because of their demonstrated lapse in upholding values. When mutiny occurs, the leader involved usually sees it as a sudden flash that is obscene. But the members involved in the action see it differently. Like an entrepreneurial team, they formulate a strategic plan for mutiny in secret, execute it tactically, and face the risks with a sense of justice and purpose. And here is the real surprise of our research: the mutinies are usually for the better. Given the connotations of the term mutiny, and the images it brings to mind, few would expect that it would have a largely ameliorative function. In our post-industrial age, mutiny is taboo. But the culture of the Age of Discovery assumed that members should depose a bad leader. It was understood that mutiny could save a venture or help it succeed. Ship captains recognized this and the best of them were, amazingly, able to harness the mutinous energy and put it in service of the venture. Christopher Columbus dealt with three mutinies during his most famous enterprise; he used the first mutiny to bolster commitment from members and discover land. Although there were also some infamously fierce mutinies, those cases turn out to have been the exceptions. Reflect for a moment on the nature of high-risk business ventures, and you might conclude that this mutinous ethos still exists. If you are familiar with entrepreneurial communities, then you know that not deposing bad leadership is hostile to the survival of a venture. Entrepreneurial founders and leaders are often removed via mutinies, and it usually happens when environmental uncertainty is most salient.  Indeed, the current entrepreneurial age, launched in mid-twentieth century Silicon Valley, is itself the product of a mutiny. The brief history is that it all began when the team at Shockley Semiconductor rose up against its founder William Shockley. The \"traitorous eight\" as Shockley would call them ever after, went on to found the set of firms (including Intel and AMD) that made Palo Alto the center of technology innovation. It was a culture-defining event that embedded assumptions still present in the Valley about the value of trained specialists, delegated power, autonomy, flat and adaptable organizational structures, and questioning flawed authority. The similarities do not end there. Another peculiarity of the Age of Discovery is that its bold seafaring ventures were revered at a sociocultural level, much as high-impact entrepreneurial exploits are revered today. Now as then, people dream of leading such ventures, and come to do so through a remarkably analogous process. By contrast, the case for mutiny is very hard to make in the modern industrial organization. Here, successful performance is defined above all by efficiency. Members cannot mutiny against their leader without violating policy, disrupting operations, and usually creating a situation even uglier than bad leadership itself. Typically, even if perceptions of the inadequacy of management are widely shared and easily justified, members can't do very much about it. Unlike in entrepreneurial communities, the notion of mutiny is anathema to the dominant logic of organizational life in big companies. That doesn't mean that those working under a bad leader don't fantasize about taking mutinous action, or indulge in more subtle forms of it. (A mutiny that is social and intellectual can still be intense.) It may mean, however, that they are putting their careers much more at risk, and that perhaps they should consider another kind of life: the authority-dashing life of the entrepreneur.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "대항해 시대의 선원들의 반란은 현대의 기업가 정신과 어떤 관련이 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "반란이 성공하는 조건에는 어떤 것들이 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "현대 산업 조직에서 반란이 일어나기 어려운 이유는 무엇인가요?"}]}
{"headline": "Italian President Sees No Room for Democratic Secession, ‘Grotesque’ State", "article": "Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said secession advocated by the governing Northern League coalition party would violate the constitution, recalling the imprisonment of a Sicilian separatist leader in the 1940s. “Within the constitution and laws, there is no room for a democratic path to secession,” Napolitano said late yesterday in Naples in remarks broadcast on Sky TG24 television. While discussions about fiscal federalism are acceptable, secession is not, the Corriere della Sera daily reported, citing Napolitano. The president pointed to the arrest of Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile for seeking to orchestrate Sicily’s secession in the 1940s, according to the report. Northern League leader Umberto Bossi has made increasingly explicit calls for the wealthier northern regions to separate from the rest of Italy. The League is one of the parties holding up Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s government, and its departure from the coalition would cause a collapse. La Padania , the Northern League’s official newspaper, responded to Napolitano today with a full, front-page article saying “I exist and am Padanian,” referring to the alternative name for Northern Italy that the League often uses. In the article, Roberto Calderoli, a party member and minister for legislative simplification, said Napolitano needs to consider people’s rights to self-determination. The League has been on Italy’s political scene for more than 20 years and has always guaranteed democracy, according to the report. “Padania does not exist,” Napolitano said yesterday, according to Corriere. He called the formation of a hypothetical separate Lombard-Venetian state “grotesque.” The president’s press service wasn’t immediately available for comment on the weekend.

{"headline": "Supreme Court Seen Influenced by Politics in Health-Care Ruling", "article": "Three-quarters of Americans say the U.S. Supreme Court will be influenced by politics when it rules on the constitutionality of a health-care law signed by President Barack Obama two years ago. The sentiment crosses party lines and is especially held by independents, 80 percent of whom say the court will not base its ruling solely on legal merits, according to a Bloomberg National Poll. More Republicans than Democrats, by 74 percent to 67 percent, say politics will play a role in the court’s health- care decision. The case is scheduled for arguments March 26-28, pitting the Obama administration against 26 states that say Congress overstepped its authority by requiring Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. “The ones that were appointed by Obama are more or less going to vote the way he would want them to,” said Republican poll participant Jacqueline Richey, an 86-year-old in Fort Myers , Florida. “Don’t get me wrong -- I don’t think they’re crooked. I just think they were appointed because they think like him.” The public’s perception of the court comes more than a decade after its 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling, which ended the Florida vote recount and let Republican George W. Bush assume the presidency. The court will be thrust into the political debate this year beyond the issue of health care. It also is scheduled to take up cases dealing with illegal immigration and race-based admission policies at universities. Political Peril “I always worry when the court steps into the political thicket,” said Barbara Perry , a Supreme Court scholar and professor at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. “It does so at its peril.” For the first time, the court’s ideological divide reflects the party of the president who appointed each of the justices. In the nine-month term that began in October 2010, the justices divided along party lines in a dozen cases. Five justices on the court, including Chief Justice John Roberts , were appointed by Republican presidents. Four were chosen by Democrats, including two, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , by Obama. The justices themselves have said they don’t make decisions for political reasons. “It is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them,” Roberts said at his 2005 Senate confirmation hearing. Legal Grounds Only Justice Stephen Breyer told Bloomberg News in a 2010 interview that politics doesn’t influence the court, even in cases with electoral implications. “It would be bad if it were there,” he said. “And I don’t see it.” The health-care case has already created some political maneuvering around the court, with partisans on each side seeking the disqualification of a justice. Opponents of the law have called for Kagan to recuse herself because she previously served as Obama’s top Supreme Court lawyer. Kagan, appointed to the court in 2010, has said she didn’t play a role in formulating the administration’s legal defense of the law. Supporters of the law have said Justice Clarence Thomas should disqualify himself because his wife, Virginia , previously worked for groups fighting passage of the measure. Thomas, who was appointed in 1991 President George H.W. Bush , is perceived by outsiders as being a likely vote to strike down the health- care law. No Recusals Neither justice has indicated any intent to step aside in the case. Roberts came to their defense in December, saying he has “complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted.” He didn’t mention either justice by name. Bloomberg asked the question: “The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide the constitutionality of the health-care reform law signed by President Obama in 2010. Do you expect the court will make this decision based solely on legal merits, or do you expect politics will influence how some justices vote?” Seventy-five percent of the 1,002 respondents said they expect politics will influence the court’s ruling, 17 percent said the decision would be based solely on legal merits and 8 percent said they weren’t sure. ‘Small Modifications’ The poll also sought opinions of the health-care law. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said it should be repealed, the same percentage as the first time Bloomberg asked the question in July 2010. Eleven percent said it should be left alone, the smallest percentage in the four polls during which the question has been asked. Just under half, 46 percent, said the law “may need small modifications, but we should see how it works.” Health care ranked fourth on a list of issues that respondents named as the most important facing the country, behind unemployment, the federal deficit and gas prices. The margin of error for the telephone poll conducted March 8-11 is 3.1 percentage points. It was done by Des Moines , Iowa- based Selzer & Co. The Bloomberg poll shows that Tea Party supporters, who seek a smaller federal government role, are particularly wary of the Supreme Court’s approach to the health-care case, with 81 percent saying politics will play a role in the decision -- the highest percentage of any subgroup the poll examined. Illegal Immigration In addition to the health-care case, the justices will rule by June on Arizona ’s illegal-immigration crackdown, which the Obama administration is challenging. Late this year, probably just before the November general election, the justices will consider whether universities must stop using race-based admissions, which are designed to help minorities gain access to higher education. “There’s a cynicism, particularly among Republicans, about judges and justices being tools of social engineering by Democrats and liberals, and that’s linked to a strain of libertarian thinking, get government off our backs, get courts of our backs,” said Perry. “What you’re seeing,” she said, “is something of a hangover from the anti-Warren court era,” From 1953 and 1969, Earl Warren served as chief justice and the court expanded federal and judicial power, particularly in the area of civil rights. Perry could recall seeing “Impeach Earl Warren” billboards along highways near Louisville, Kentucky , where she grew up. Republican presidents appointed Warren and every chief justice since. The Supreme Court has typically been held in higher esteem than Congress or the president, Perry said. “I just think that justices live in this isolated world where they surround themselves with academics and the law,” said poll respondent Jeffrey North, a 36-year-old information technology employee in Grant, Michigan. He identified himself as an independent. “Maybe I’m naive but I hope that at that level of the judiciary, they’re interpreting the Constitution, not basing things on politics.” To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Bykowicz in Washington at  jbykowicz@bloomberg.net ; Greg Stohr in Washington at  gstohr@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeanne Cummings at  jcummings21@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미국 대법원의 정당성 인식에 영향을 미치는 주요 요인은 무엇인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "미국 대법원의 정당성 인식과 실제 판결 사이에 어떤 관계가 있는가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "미국 대법원의 정당성 인식이 향후 정책 결정과 정치 환경에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "Risk Unrewarded as Emerging Stocks Lag Behind Most Since ’98", "article": "The link between risk and reward in stocks is breaking down as emerging markets post the worst first quarter since 2008 and lag behind shares of developed economies by the most in 15 years. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ’s 3.8 percent drop this year through last week trimmed its rebound from an October 2011 low to 22 percent. That compares with a 33 percent advance for the MSCI World Index and marks the first time since 1998 that developing-country shares have underperformed during a global rally. When adjusted for price swings , emerging market returns are 37 percent smaller than in advanced nations, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While higher volatility in developing countries led to outsized gains during the last six bull markets, this time is proving different as government intervention curbs profits at companies such as PetroChina Co. (857) and Light SA and growth slows from South Korea to Poland. Bulls say emerging markets will lead the next stage of the global rally as record low interest rates send investors into riskier securities. Pessimists say the trend will continue as investors favor more transparent markets. “The old rules of thumb may need to be questioned,” Wayne Lin, a money manager at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc., which oversees about $661 billion, said in a phone interview. “It is surprising to many investors that emerging markets haven’t participated in the rally.” Correlation Drops Money managers surveyed by Bank of America Corp. cut developing-nation shares in March for the first time in six months while boosting positions in the U.S. (SPX) to the highest level since July, Michael Hartnett, the bank’s chief investment strategist in New York, wrote in a March 19 report. Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest brokerage, reduced its estimate for gains in emerging-market equities on March 18 while boosting its projections for U.S. and Japanese shares. MSCI’s emerging index rose 0.6 percent at 4 p.m. in New York, after falling 2.6 percent last week. The MSCI World (MXWO) Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,426.61 after a 0.8 percent decline last week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent to 1,551.69. The 120-day correlation between the two MSCI gauges fell to an eight-year low of 0.54 on March 14. A reading of 1 shows lockstep moves, while minus 1 means opposite directions. Asian Crisis Investors willing to endure bigger price swings in developing nations have usually been rewarded during global stock rallies. Emerging shares beat developed equities by an average 46 percentage points during bull markets -- defined as a gain of at least 20 percent in the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) from a recent low without a decline of the same magnitude -- since the index data began in 1988. Now, developing markets are trailing after most of their companies missed analyst profit estimates for the last five quarters and economic expansions from China to Brazil slowed to the weakest rates since 2009. A majority of MSCI World companies beat earnings projections, while the pace of U.S. growth has rebounded to levels reached before the financial crisis. The only other bull market emerging stocks lagged behind was from September 1990 through July 1998, a period when U.S. shares surged during the dot-com bubble and Asian (MXAPJ) equities were dragged down by the region’s financial crisis. Volatility (EEM) in the MSCI emerging index was higher than that of the developed-country gauge during each rally, by about 30 percent on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emerging equities also posted steeper declines and bigger price swings than developed shares during bear markets, the data show. ‘Safety Play’ The current rally suggests equity investors are still hesitant to take on risk, five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930s sparked a contraction in the global economy and wiped out $37 trillion of stock market value , according to Wells Fargo Advisors LLC’s Scott Wren. “It’s a safety play,” said Wren, the St. Louis, Missouri- based senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, which oversees about $1.2 trillion. “People want to own stocks more than they did a while ago, but they want to be a little cautious.” Brazilian shares led the decline in emerging markets this year, with the benchmark Bovespa Index (IBOV) falling 9.4 percent. Light SA (LIGT3) , a Rio de Janeiro-based power distributor, tumbled 18 percent this year as President Dilma Rousseff cut electricity rates by as much as 32 percent in a bid to boost economic growth. Poland’s WIG20 Index (WIG20) dropped 8.2 percent as figures showed the nation’s economic expansion slowed for a fourth straight quarter in the period ended December. Economic Surprises Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) surged 19 percent in 2013, the biggest gain among 45 equity indexes in emerging and developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest consumer electronics exporter, jumped 73 percent this year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took steps to weaken the yen and revive the economy with more expansionary monetary policies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 9.2 percent since the end of December and closed last week at 1,556.89, within 1 percent of its all-time high. Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, increased 14 percent this year as the Federal Reserve pledged to continue its unprecedented monetary stimulus and the housing market showed signs of a sustained recovery. ‘Enormous Momentum’ The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, a measure of how much reports are exceeding economists’ estimates, rose to a two-month high on March 14 while the gauge for emerging markets shows reports have trailed projections since January. “The U.S. has been delivering,” said Russ Koesterich, the chief investment strategist at New York-based BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager with $3.8 trillion in assets. Not all emerging markets are losing. Thailand’s SET Index has surged 73 percent since the current global rally began on Oct. 4, 2011, while the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP) rose 70 percent. The Thai economy may expand by as much as 5.5 percent this year and the Philippines will probably grow at least 6 percent, according to government estimates. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict a 1.9 percent expansion in the U.S. “These are emerging markets and they have flaws,” said Byron Wien, vice chairman of the advisory services unit at Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity. “They also have enormous economic momentum and the developed markets are mature and the momentum is not as pronounced.” Lower Debt Wien said emerging markets will lead gains in global stocks this year with “double digit” returns. Developing nations are becoming safer bets by some measures. Government debt has declined to 34 percent of gross domestic product from 52 percent a decade ago, according to the Washington-based International Monetary Fund. That compares with 110 percent in advanced countries. Emerging markets have more than $6 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The extra yield investors demand to own their sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries has narrowed to 3 percentage points, or 300 basis points, from an average of 371 during the past five years, according to the JPMorgan EMBI Global Index. “Relative to Europe and Japan, emerging markets do not have the same indebtedness problem,” said David Kelly, who helps oversee about $400 billion as the New York-based chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Rousseff Intervention Developing stocks also have lower valuations. The MSCI emerging gauge trades for 10 times analysts’ 12-month profit estimates , versus 13 times for the MSCI World, the widest gap since November 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the biggest emerging markets, government interference is eroding returns for minority shareholders. PetroChina, which dropped 6.7 percent in Hong Kong trading this year, posted annual earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates on March 21 as the government capped retail fuel and natural gas prices to contain inflation. Brazil’s Rousseff has intervened to curb utility rates, bank lending margins, mobile-phone fees and fuel prices -- reducing earnings prospects for industries with a combined weighting of about 50 percent in the Bovespa index. OAO MRSK Holding (MRKH) , a Moscow-based power distributor, tumbled 49 percent during the past 12 months as President Vladimir Putin delayed tariff increases and signed a decree to combine the company with state-run Federal Grid Co., instead of selling shares to private investors as some analysts had anticipated. Fed Stimulus “The risk of the emerging markets is that the institutional frameworks are still a work in progress,” said Rupal Bhansali, who helps oversee about $5 billion as a New York-based chief investment officer for international equities at Ariel Investments LLC. Inflation is preventing central banks in emerging markets from stimulating their economies as much as developed nations, said Jason Hsu, the chief investment officer of Newport Beach, California-based Research Affiliates LLC. Consumer prices in Brazil rose at the fastest pace since December 2011 in February, spurring speculation that the central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate this year. People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said at a March 13 press conference that policy makers should be on “high alert” over inflation, while India’s central bank said on March 19 that scope for further monetary easing is limited. By contrast, the Federal Reserve maintained its $85 billion-a-month bond purchase program on March 20 and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda vowed the next day to pursue “bold” monetary stimulus. “I can certainly see quantitative easing continuing” in advanced economies, said Andrew Milligan, who helps oversee about $264 billion as head of global strategy at Edinburgh-based Standard Life Investments Ltd. “At the margin, that’s going to support developed rather than emerging markets.” To contact the reporters on this story: Michael Patterson in Hong Kong at  mpatterson10@bloomberg.net ; Inyoung Hwang in New York at  ihwang7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at  lthomasson@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "신흥국 주식과 선진국 주식의 위험과 수익 간의 관계가 최근 어떻게 변화하고 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "신흥국 주식이 최근 글로벌 랠리에서 뒤처진 이유는 무엇이며, 이는 어떤 요인들과 관련이 있나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "신흥국 주식의 밸류에이션이 낮은 상황에서, 정부 개입이 기업 수익에 미치는 영향과 이를 고려한 투자 전략은 어떻게 수립할 수 있을까요?"}]}
{"headline": "China Yuan Climbs to 19-Year High on Record Fixing, Export Data", "article": "The yuan rose to a 19-year high as the central bank strengthened the daily fixing to a record and Chinese exports topped analysts’ estimates. The currency completed its biggest two-day gain in 15 months as an official report showed overseas sales rose 14.7 percent in April from a year earlier, beating the 9.2 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and March’s 10 percent gain. The People’s Bank of China raised the daily reference rate 0.17 percent to a record 6.1980 per dollar. The currency can diverge a maximum 1 percent from the fixing. The yuan rose 0.21 percent to 6.1410 per dollar in Shanghai , taking the two-day gain to 0.42 percent, the most since Jan. 31, 2012, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.1396 earlier, the strongest level since the government unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. “The size of capital inflows into China and onshore demand for the yuan continue to dominate,” said Khoon Goh, a strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “I still expect further near-term appreciation pressure.” Yuan positions at Chinese financial institutions stemming from foreign-exchange transactions, a gauge of cross-border capital flows, climbed 236 billion yuan ($38 billion) in March, central bank data show. Gains are a sign of inflows, and the positions increased 1.22 trillion yuan in the first three months of this year. Five-Year Plan China may introduce a five-year plan for yuan capital- account convertibility this year, China Securities Journal reported today, citing Chen Bingcai, a former deputy chief at State Administration of Foreign Exchange’s capital account management department. The yuan’s capital account may be convertible by 2020, the report said. In Hong Kong , the yuan gained 0.25 percent to 6.1414 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.29 percent to 6.21, a 1.1 percent discount to the onshore exchange rate. One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, increased 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 1.76 percent.

{"headline": "Petrobras First Female CEO Is Rousseff’s Response to Delayed Oil", "article": "As Maria das Gracas Silva Foster took over as chief executive officer at Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , she couldn’t help giving a shout-out to two forces that have shaped her life. The first went to Petrobras, the world’s biggest deep-water oil producer, on whose Rio de Janeiro stage she was standing on Feb. 13 to be sworn in as CEO, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. The second was to her mother, who decades ago encouraged a work ethic that propelled her young daughter from a poor neighborhood to the pinnacle of her profession. “The badge and I have been together for more than 30 years,” Foster told several hundred employees as departing CEO Jose Sergio Gabrielli handed her a symbolic Petrobras ID card. “I thank my mother, Terezinha, for the power of her transforming love.” Foster, a 58-year-old engineer who favors pantsuits and has two small stars tattooed on her wrist, is leading Latin America’s biggest company by market value just as Brazil ’s economy cools. During a decade-long boom, at least 30 million Brazilians have emerged from poverty, and the country now has at least 100,000 millionaires. In 2011, though, growth slowed to 2.7 percent from an annual average of 4.6 percent in the previous four years. Self-Sufficient Brazil is counting on Petrobras to provide national energy self-sufficiency that will meet the demands of a growing economy. The company, which is 51 percent controlled by the government, produces 91 percent of Brazil’s oil and 90 percent of its natural gas. It’s struggling to increase output and develop reserves after new offshore wells have failed to compensate for faster- than-expected declines at older fields. That imbalance is putting Petrobras behind in reaching its 2020 target of 6.4 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from the current 2.6 million. Petrobras will account for about 40 percent of the 922 billion reais ($456 billion) in energy and infrastructure spending in Brazil from 2010 to 2015, even as the country splurges on airports and stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. ‘Tremendously Important’ “Oil and gas are an increasingly important sector of the economy and will only grow in size and import,” says Christopher Garman , an analyst who covers Latin America at Eurasia Group in New York. “The capacity of Petrobras to deliver is tremendously important.” Investors are betting that Foster, an engineer who has spent 31 years immersed in Petrobras -- from its drilling platforms to its management suites -- is the right person for the job. Petrobras stock, hit by the slowing output growth, jumped 3.8 percent on Jan. 23 when she was named the company’s first female CEO -- the biggest increase in eight months. Nick Robinson , a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in Sao Paulo , says Foster is a skilled technical manager who can tackle glitches that have forced unscheduled shutdowns at drilling sites. Delays in platform construction and increased outages to perform maintenance began surfacing during Gabrielli’s tenure. The former CEO, an economist and academic, focused more on finances than on day-to-day operations as he shepherded Petrobras’s $70 billion share offering in September 2010, the world’s biggest. Attractive Bonds Today, public shareholders own 49 percent of the company’s voting stock. Petrobras shares have dropped 29 percent since the share offering through May 31. Luz Padilla, who helps manage $1 billion of emerging-market debt, including Petrobras, at Doubleline Capital LP in Los Angeles , is bullish on the company. “It’s an industry that could reshape the profile of Brazil, given the potential of their finds,’’ she says. Padilla says Petrobras bonds are attractive compared with such global peers as BP Plc because they have a lower price and higher yield, paying more interest. Foster is pushing Petrobras to cut through bottlenecks. In May, she created a management position to oversee the purchase and installation of platforms, rigs and pipelines. The division will try to head off cost overruns and construction setbacks at local yards that have slowed progress at a company with 80,000 employees and 244 billion reais in annual revenue. “Someone like her, who is perhaps more of an operational person, could be a huge asset,” says Robinson, whose firm held 5.8 million Petrobras shares on Feb. 29. Detail-Oriented Manuel Fernandes, head of KPMG International’s oil and gas division in Rio, met Foster when she ran Petrobras’s natural gas business and KPMG was its auditor. He says she knows the nitty- gritty of the company and the industry. “You wouldn’t expect someone in her position to look into too many details, but she does,” he says. “That’s how she is.” Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is another fan. The two, now among the world’s most powerful female leaders, began working together in 2003. Rousseff was energy minister under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Foster, who holds a degree in chemical engineering from the Fluminense Federal University in Niteroi, in Rio de Janeiro state, was Rousseff’s secretary for oil, natural gas and renewable fuels. ‘Good Hands’ Foster returned to Petrobras in 2005, while Rousseff served as its chairman from 2003 through 2010. Like Rousseff, Foster is a member of the governing Workers’ Party, which has close ties to unions. The party’s jobs programs and subsidies for poor households have helped vault millions into the middle class. “With Graca at the helm, Petrobras will be in good hands,” Rousseff said at the February event, using Foster’s nickname. “I know the work capacity, competence and seriousness with which Graca dedicates herself, not only to this company but also to everything she does in her professional life.” For investors, Foster’s first order of business is to boost output , which rose 1.5 percent last year, to an average 2.6 million barrels per day of oil equivalent. It was the slowest pace since 2007 and well below the company’s 7.7 percent target. The new CEO is stymied by rules enacted under Lula. Petrobras must buy as much as 70 percent of its equipment -- from giant offshore platforms to polyester rope for anchors -- from domestic suppliers. Local Rules The former president set the local-content regulations to aid Brazil’s oil services industry and reduce reliance on imports. In December, Petrobras canceled a plan to lease 21 drilling rigs after offers by local suppliers proved too expensive. One bidder, Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, is a shipbuilder that Petrobras and the Brazilian Development Bank formed to construct the platforms. In an effort to control inflation , which reached 5.2 percent in March, the government also caps how much Petrobras can charge for gasoline. The price of fuel in early May was 4.38 reais per gallon at the refinery gate, a 21 percent discount from international markets, according to estimates by Banco Bradesco SA. Brazilian motorists pay more at the pump than U.S. drivers do because of taxes. With domestic prices low, Petrobras loses money on every liter of imported gasoline and diesel it sells in Brazil. Foster must guide the company through some of the world’s most challenging petroleum-engineering feats. She knows the territory, having been the first woman at Petrobras to board an oil platform in the Atlantic Ocean to install drilling equipment. Drilling Deep As of March, 90 percent of Petrobras’s oil production in Brazil came from offshore fields, most from wells at depths of more than 300 meters (980 feet). With these wells aging, Petrobras is betting on so-called pre-salt fields -- regions as deep as 7,000 meters and as far as 300 kilometers (186 miles) from land. Rough seas, tricky geology and the distance workers must travel make drilling more complex than in the Campos Basin off southeastern Brazil, where Petrobras gained most of its expertise. Petrobras will be going it alone with these deep wells. A law passed in 2010 requires the company to be the sole operator of new pre-salt developments. Foreign oil companies can only take stakes, not run the sites. “That’s a problem,” says Scott Black , president of Delphi Management Inc., an investment management firm in Boston. He says Petrobras is a good investment that would be even more attractive if Brazil’s oil industry were a free market. “Free enterprise might do better long term,” he says. Chevron Spill Foster is also navigating the environmental hazards of drilling in deep waters. Chevron Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company, spilled 3,000 barrels in November at the Frade Field, where Petrobras is a partner. It was Brazil’s eighth- most-productive area until Chevron suspended drilling. Prosecutors are going after Chevron with three lawsuits seeking a total of 40 billion reais in damages, and lawmakers have demanded investigations into the incident. Petrobras said in a March 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it’s liable for 30 percent of any payments for the spill. Petrobras foresees as much as $527 million in possible losses from other environmental claims. Among these are a July 2000 spill at the President Getulio Vargas Refinery in Araucaria, Parana state, and payouts to fishermen for a spill in Rio that same year, the company said in the filing. Jobs Machine Ultimately, Foster, with guidance from Rousseff’s government, will have to decide whether to run Petrobras as a state-owned, job-creating bureaucracy or a modern public company. Today, the government names seven members of the 10- person board, and shareholders lack any real power. Petrobras workers say the company must tilt toward local industries and the interests of Brazil. “Petrobras can’t produce oil according to what’s needed by others,” says Silvio Sinedino, who represents employees on the company’s board. “It can’t be a company that’s concerned about revenue for the sake of revenue.” Jim Crandell, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York who leads coverage of oil services providers, says ignoring market realities can hurt Petrobras. “The goal of Brazil seems to be to provide employment to its citizens,” he says. “Brazil may find that it has to pay more for equipment and services going forward. There certainly is the risk of material delays.” ‘Net Exporter’ Should Foster overcome Petrobras’s drilling hurdles, appease shareholders, satisfy employees and boost output as planned, Brazil may go from being almost self-sufficient in oil to becoming a big source for the U.S. and other consumers. President Barack Obama said during a 2011 visit that he wants the country to be a major U.S. supplier. “If Petrobras doesn’t help Brazil by increasing production growth, there’s a serious chance Brazil moves back into an oil- importing situation and loses its status as a self-sufficient producer,” says analyst Gustavo Gattass at Banco BTG Pactual SA in Rio. T.J. Conway, a research and advisory manager at New York- based Energy Intelligence Group, says Petrobras must strike a balance between local demands and exporting. “Brazil can definitely be a contributor to global markets and an important player, and perhaps eclipse the rest of the region in terms of being a net exporter,” he says. Dubbed ‘Caveirao’ Foster, whom colleagues have dubbed “Caveirao” in a reference to the armored vehicles police deploy in crime-ridden neighborhoods, is used to plowing through roadblocks. Her mother raised young Graca and her sister, Rita, in Rio’s Morro do Adeus, a poor neighborhood that eventually deteriorated into a shantytown. Her mother worked. Her father was an alcoholic, Foster told Bloomberg News last year. Graca collected cans and paper for pocket money until the family moved in with an aunt in Niteroi. Foster graduated from Fluminense Federal University in 1978, going on to earn a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a Master of Business Administration from the Rio-based Getulio Vargas Foundation. She joined Petrobras’s exploration and production division as an intern in 1979. Corporate Ladder Two years later, she boarded an offshore oil platform to install equipment, going on to manage the drilling division. She became the first woman to run Petrobras’s field engineering, taking over the distribution unit and the chemical and petrochemical division, Petroquisa. In September 2007, Gabrielli named her Petrobras’s first female director, the second-highest management level, when she took charge at the gas and energy division. Today, of about 12,200 engineers at Petrobras, about 1,400 are women. Foster married and had a daughter. She then divorced, remarried and had a son. Her second marriage stirred controversy after Brazilian newspapers reported that husband Colin Foster owned an engineering company that had supplied Petrobras with equipment from 2007 to 2010. Petrobras responded in 2010, saying the division Foster headed didn’t do business with Colin Foster’s company, according to Petrobras’s website. Foster, wearing a pink suit with a satin blouse at headquarters the year before she was named CEO, said she had to be 100 percent available for her job. “I have two children,” she said in the January 2011 interview in a 23rd-floor office with a view of Guanabara Bay. “I gave up a lot for my career, but I’m very happy for it. I’ve done what I’ve always thought was best for me and my family.” ‘Above Expectations’ Foster expects similar dedication from her employees. She says she wants her staff to work one day a week -- joking that the day starts on Monday and ends on Saturday. “I once called one of my managers, and he answered while he was bathing his two children,” she recalls. “While he spoke, he dropped the cell phone in the tub, picked it up and continued talking.” Marcio Mello, CEO of Brazilian oil explorer HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA, worked with Foster for 18 years. He recalls their time at the research division, Cenpes, which develops technology to explore the pre-salt region. “She’s the kind of person you give a mission to and she delivers above expectations,” Mello says, showing a framed photo of himself with Foster in 1999, when they received a research award for their work at Cenpes. “This is why Graca will do a fantastic job at Petrobras. She’s fair, a hard worker, focused; she has targets; she’s a performer. My dream is to have a person like Graca at HRT.” Oil Women Foster isn’t the only woman leading Brazil’s energy effort. There’s also Magda Chambriard, who, like Foster, rose through Petrobras. She heads Brazil’s oil regulator, ANP. “Brazil is in a unique moment,” Mello says. “Now we have two ladies, not only with huge experience but huge knowledge.” Chambriard’s job at the regulator ends years of the plum political appointment going to people with little oil experience. Foster’s promotion at Petrobras may mean continued government meddling, Delphi’s Black says. “They’ve got probably the best drilling profile of any of the national oil companies,” he says of Petrobras. “They’ve got expansive fields off the coast. The problem is, the government keeps upping the ante.” ‘Slightly Aggressive’ Black points to the controls on gasoline as one way the government hurts the company. Publicly traded competitors benefited as oil prices rose 8.3 percent during the fourth quarter. Petrobras lost by operating as an arm of the government instead of competing in a free market. Fourth-quarter net income dropped to 5.05 billion reais, 52 percent less than a year earlier. Foster may be willing to challenge Rousseff on gasoline prices. Petrobras’s budget for 2012 estimated oil at about $90 a barrel. With oil above $110, she told an April conference organized by the Brazilian Oil, Gas and Biofuel Institute that prices may have to be adjusted. “The very fact that she’s brought this argument to the forefront and is being slightly aggressive means the government is being tested,” Aberdeen’s Robinson says. “There’d be a pretty clear signal that they are going to use Petrobras as a tool of economic policy rather than let it be run for the benefit of minority shareholders if they don’t allow the company to increase prices.” Effort Ahead At the same time, employees are demanding that Foster look after them. Board member Sinedino, an engineer in the seismic department, says Petrobras must improve worker safety. He expects Foster to remain an ally. “She is one of us,” he says. “She has spent her life at the company, has worked everywhere; she knows exactly what’s going on and what needs to be done.” Foster, in her acceptance speech, acknowledged the effort ahead. “Taking over the company is a big challenge, bigger than the combination of all those challenges I faced till I reached this day,” she said. Then she touched her heart in a gesture to her Petrobras colleagues. “I owe the moment to you all,” she said. “Finally, I thank the Lord for this moment, my children for accepting me as I am, and my mother, Dona Terezinha.” To contact the reporters on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Rio de Janeiro at  rorihuela@bloomberg.net  Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at  pmillard1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at  dcrofts@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "브라질의 경제 성장과 빈곤 탈출에 석유 산업, 특히 페트로브라스가 어떤 역할을 했나요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "페트로브라스의 생산량 증가 목표와 실제 성장률 간의 격차가 기업 가치와 리스크 프로파일에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있을까요?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "페트로브라스의 경영진이 제시하는 가이던스와 실적 설명이 과거 행동, 인센티브 구조, 시장 기대와 어떻게 맞물리는지 분석해보세요."}]}
{"headline": "Lithium Demand May Triple by 2020 on Demand for Batteries, Orocobre Says", "article": "Lithium demand may triple in the next decade as consumers buy more portable electronics and battery-powered vehicles, said James D. Calaway , chairman of lithium miner Orocobre Ltd.  Global lithium demand of about 110,000 metric tons may double by 2020 solely from existing applications such as mobile phones and glass making, Calaway said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. Sales to electric-vehicle battery makers will add 10,000 tons by 2015 before increasing more rapidly, he said. “You could very easily see by 2020 the need to triple production or even more just to accommodate the auto sector,” Calaway said. Orocobre will begin producing lithium in 2012 at its first project, Salar de Olaroz, atop salt flats in Argentina’s Jujuy province, he said. The company should become profitable the next year when output reaches 15,000 tons of lithium and 36,000 tons of potash fertilizer, he said. The Brisbane, Australia-based company may start pumping lithium-rich water from a second mine in Argentina in 2014, said Calaway, 53. The second project, called Salar de Salinas Grandes, will boost Orocobre’s total annual lithium production to as much as 40,000 tons, making it the world’s fourth-biggest producer, Calaway said. Toyota Partnership Toyota Tsusho Corp., an affiliate of Toyota Motor Corp., is financing the $100 million to $120 million cost of Salar de Olaroz in exchange for a 25 percent stake in the project. Toyota also may market the mine’s lithium for Orocobre to Asian manufacturers, he said. Salinas Grandes may cost as much as $150 million and will be financed from cash generated by the first mine or with partners such as Toyota, Calaway said. Prices for lithium carbonate, the processed form of the mineral used in lithium-ion batteries, are likely to remain in a range of $4,000 to $6,000 a ton, Calaway said. Prices fell last year as much as 20 percent from a peak of about $6,500 in 2008, and have climbed back to about $6,000, he said. Prices may drop through 2015 if capacity increases faster than demand, Calaway said. “We are managing our business with the assumption that it’s going to be fairly tough” through 2014, Calaway said. “And then I think we get into a fairly substantial period where you get very strong firming of prices. From 2015 through 2025, it is going to be a wonderful time to have low-cost lithium production.” Orocobre’s cost of production will be less than output from lithium rock mines, primarily in Australia, that comprise 35 percent of global output, he said. Orocobre fell 20 cents, or 8 percent, to C$2.29 yesterday in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. To contact the reporter on this story: Jack Kaskey in New York at  jkaskey@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Microsoft Faces EU Antitrust Probe Over Web-Brower Choice", "article": "Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) risks European Union penalties for failing to comply with a settlement to give users a choice of web browsers, more than two years after it tried to end a decade-long clash with antitrust regulators. EU Competition Commission Joaquin Almunia said Microsoft may have misled regulators by failing to display a browser choice screen to users of the Windows operating system since February 2011. The world’s largest software company blamed a technical error for not showing the screen to some users and offered to extend its commitment until March 2016. Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.06 billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to offer access to rival browsers as a part of a 2009 settlement to repair its relationship with the bloc’s regulators. It told regulators last December that it was complying with its commitments. “I trusted that the company’s reports were accurate,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. “If, following our investigation, the infringement was confirmed, Microsoft should expect sanctions.” Microsoft said it only learned this month that it didn’t offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers that should have received it. It blamed a technical error and said it has already started distributing a fix. Deep ‘Regret’ “We deeply regret that this error occurred and we apologize for it,” Microsoft said in a statement. “We understand that the commission may decide to impose other sanctions.” Almunia said he may have to step up how regulators supervise companies’ commitments to end antitrust probes. Recent binding pledges by Standard & Poor’s (MHP) and Electricite de France SA (EDF) “are particularly complex and require strengthening of our monitoring,” Almunia told reporters in Brussels. Michael Privitera, a spokesman for Standard & Poor’s in New York , declined to immediately comment. EDF in Paris declined to comment. Regulators only became aware that Microsoft’s browser choice screens weren’t working when they received complaints, he said, without identifying who had alerted the EU. The EU’s new probe is a “real surprise, given Microsoft’s long and painful past” with regulators and earlier fines imposed for not complying with the earlier investigation, said Mark Tricker, a lawyer with Norton Rose LLP in Brussels. Repeat Offenses Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat offenses, Almunia said in a reference to the EU’s 2008 penalty for the company’s failure to obey an earlier EU decision. That ruling ordered it to provide information to software developers to make compatible products. EU antitrust fines are usually capped at 10 percent of yearly revenue. Under the terms of Microsoft’s 2009 pledge, consumers who buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Microsoft said today that it would extend this browser choice for an extra 15 months, or until March 2016. After settling with the EU, Microsoft moved to the other side of the fence, filing complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and what is now its Motorola Mobility unit for alleged antitrust violations. Microsoft declined 0.7 percent to $29.25 at 11:21 a.m. in New York. To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at  awhite62@bloomberg.net.

{"headline": "Seven French Refineries Ready to Resume Processing; Await Crude Supplies", "article": "Seven oil refineries in France are ready to resume processing as soon as crude supplies become available from ships stranded by month-long port strikes. “The refiners are back at work but they cannot operate because they don’t have any crude oil,” Yves le Goff, a spokesman for refiner’s group UFIP, said by phone today from Paris. France’s 11 refineries can process 1.84 million barrels of oil a day, according to Bloomberg data. Plants such as Total SA’s La Mede facility began halting production as early as Oct. 10 amid protests that began at ports on Sept. 27, before escalating over President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s pension reform. Workers at the oil terminal of Marseille on France’s southern coast were on strike today leaving 38 crude carriers and 20 refined product vessels stranded, according to an e- mailed statement from port officials. Total’s La Mede plant in the south is in the preliminary stages of start-up following the end of strike action, Michael Crochet-Vourey , a company spokesman, said yesterday. The company’s other facilities remain halted amid countrywide protests. Workers at Petroplus Holdings AG’s Petit Couronne site voted yesterday to return to work and fuel deliveries have resumed, Sevillane Lambret, a CFDT union representative said today by phone. Staff at the company’s other French plant at Reichstett agreed to return to work at the beginning of the week and production remained halted because of limited oil feedstock. Swiss Halt Petroplus was forced to start closing its Cressier refinery in Switzerland because of a lack of crude, the company said on Oct. 26. The plant relies on oil from France via a pipeline. Ineos AG started to reduce production to “stand-by” mode at its Lavera refinery and petrochemical site in the south of France because of limited raw materials, the company said on Oct. 25. “We’re keeping the assets warm and when we get the crude, we’ll ramp up production,” Richard Longden , a U.K.-based Ineos spokesman, said yesterday. Exxon Mobil Corp. said yesterday its employees wouldn’t take part in today’s nationwide protests over the government’s plan to increase the minimum age of retirement to 62 from 60. The company’s 233,000 barrel-a-day Gravenchon refinery, which depends on crude supplies from the port of Le Havre, was waiting for shipments, and its 119,000 barrel-a-day Fos facility in the south of France was running at reduced rates, said Catherine Brun , an Exxon spokeswoman. Both sites had resumed fuel deliveries. The following table shows the status of French refineries, ranked by processing capacity in barrels a day. The Cressier plant in Switzerland is the only one outside France affected by the strikes as it gets crude supplies via pipeline from Fos.

{"headline": "Indonesian Bonds Extend Gains on Surprise Central Bank Rate Cut", "article": "Indonesia ’s benchmark 10-year bonds extended gains, pushing yields to the lowest level in a month, after the central bank unexpectedly cut borrowing costs. The rupiah maintained its decline after the decision. The notes advanced for a fourth day on speculation the central bank is buying the debt as foreigners trim their holdings. Bank Indonesia lowered its reference rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent after holding it steady for seven months, citing easing inflation. All 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicted the rate would stay at 6.75 percent. The yield on the 10-year bond fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.57 percent as of 3:29 p.m. in Jakarta, prices compiled by Bloomberg showed. The rate was down five basis points before policy makers announced their decision. “The central bank is worried about slowing growth in the global economy,” said Juniman, chief economist at PT Bank Internasional Indonesia in Jakarta who goes by only one name. “The rupiah will depreciate in the short term because yields are going down. Investors expected the rate to be flat.” The rupiah was 0.4 percent weaker at 8,941 per dollar, according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It traded at 8,938 in the run-up to the announcement. The currency fell 4 percent in the past month and reached 9,115 on Sept. 26, the lowest level since June 2010, as a faltering U.S. economy and Europe ’s debt crisis curbed investor appetite for emerging-market assets, including Indonesia. Bond Holdings The central bank said today inflation this year may be lower than 5 percent. Consumer prices rose 4.61 percent in September from a year earlier after having climbed 4.79 percent the prior month, official data showed on Oct. 3. The 10-year yield, which reached a record low of 6.45 percent on Sept. 9, dropped 57 basis points in the last three days. The central bank will purchase government bonds and remain in the currency market to stabilize the rupiah, Hendar, director of monetary policy who uses only one name, said on Oct. 3. Foreign ownership of the nation’s debt declined 4 trillion rupiah ($447 million) this month through Oct. 5 to 214.1 trillion rupiah, after record withdrawals of 29.3 trillion rupiah in September, according to data from the finance ministry’s website. “BI is trying to make yields go down,” said Handy Yunianto, a fixed-income analyst at Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta. “Foreigners are still cutting their holdings of government bonds. They are trying to take profits and wait for better entry levels to come in.” The government will aim to sell today 500 billion rupiah of Islamic bonds maturing in six months to 25 years, Yunianto said. Indonesian bonds have returned 16 percent so far this year, the best performance among 10 Asian local-currency debt markets tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc. Debt in the Philippines and Singapore delivered the second-biggest gains, rising 6.8 percent.

{"headline": "Severed Pipe, Hard Hats Seized by U.S. in BP Well Probe", "article": "The U.S. Coast Guard seized a section of pipe from BP Plc’s leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a federal investigation into the catastrophe that killed 11 rig workers and triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  The 50-foot (15-meter) section of pipe was attached to a stack of safety valves on the sea floor known as a blowout preventer, said Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Jeff Bray.  Investigators plan to examine the pipe at a Coast Guard base in New Orleans for clues about what caused BP’s Macondo well to spew out of control on April 20, Bray said today. The well has been pumping as much as 60,000 barrels of crude a day into the sea for more than two months, fouling fisheries, oyster beds and beaches.  “This is something we’re examining as part of the ongoing investigation,” Bray said in a telephone interview from Washington.  The 50 feet of pipe was severed from the blowout preventer in the weeks following the disaster to allow remotely controlled robots to attempt to cap the leaking well. The section was originally part of a 5,000-foot string of pipes that connected the well to the Deepwater Horizon rig until the vessel sank on April 22.  The Coast Guard took possession of the pipe section from Transocean Ltd., the Geneva-based rig owner, under the terms of a subpoena issued by an investigative panel comprised of Coast Guard and Interior Department representatives, court documents show.  Debris, Logs  Transocean has also been ordered to hand over any debris from the wrecked rig and personnel logs that cover the period from when the Deepwater Horizon arrived at the Macondo site about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast earlier this year, the documents show.  Hard hats and storage tanks used to hold mechanical oil are among the debris that has been recovered from the disaster zone and handed over to the Coast Guard for examination, said Guy Cantwell, a Transocean spokesman. The blowout preventer won’t be detached from the sea floor and brought to the surface until the leak has been capped, he said.  A BP spokeswoman in the company’s Houston office who declined to be identified said she was unable to immediately comment.  The investigative panel is scheduled to resume hearing testimony from survivors and company executives on July 19, Bray said. The panel has yet to determine who it will summon to provide testimony, he said.  At the last round of hearings in late May, Robert Kaluza, one of two BP managers involved in directing the drilling project aboard the rig, declined to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  Poor Health  Donald Vidrine, the other BP manager who oversaw the project aboard the Deepwater Horizon, postponed a May appearance before the panel, telling investigators he was in poor health.  In a June 23 interview outside his home in Lafayette, Louisiana, Vidrine declined to say whether he will testify when the hearings resume later this month. Vidrine said he had been on administrative leave from the company since the catastrophe.  In addition to the Coast Guard and Interior Department, investigations are under way by the Justice Department, U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and several House and Senate committees.  BP and contractors that included Transocean and Halliburton Co. were in the process of sealing the Macondo well with cement plugs when the rig was rocked by two explosions and caught fire.  50 Million Barrels  BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward last month estimated the well, which lies under almost 1 mile of water, tapped a field holding 50 million barrels of crude. At current prices, that much crude is worth about $3.6 billion.  London-based BP rose 2.8 percent to 327.95 pence today. Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, rose 3 percent to $37.17 in New York trading. Transocean rose 5.5 percent to $48.89.  BP, the largest oil and natural-gas producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which owns a minority stake in the well, have each lost half their market value since the disaster.  Mitsui & Co ., the Tokyo-based owner of an indirect stake in the project, lost almost one-third of its value. Transocean has tumbled 47 percent.

Such plans on the handset are “not a long-term solution,” Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said today at a Morgan Stanley conference. Verizon Wireless, co-owned by Vodafone Group Plc and Verizon Communications, ended AT&T Inc.’s four-year exclusive hold on the iPhone in the U.S. Analysts, including Wells Fargo & Co.’s Jennifer Fritzsche , estimate Verizon may sell 2 million iPhones this quarter. After beginning iPhone sales in February, Verizon said it may limit the download speeds for some customers, who are among the top 5 percent in data consumption, in areas where they risk jamming the network. Verizon also has an opportunity for additional revenue as customers adopt smartphones, such as the iPhone, because they tend to use more data than customers with more traditional devices, Shammo said. “We have a very big opportunity at Verizon Wireless because 67 percent of our customers are either feature phones or multimedia phones,” which have optional data plans of about $10 per month, said Shammo. “We see the potential of our customer base spending in that $30 to $50 range.” Online iPhone Sales AT&T in June stopped offering unlimited data plans, except to those already under contract. The Dallas-based carrier offers a $15 plan for 200 megabytes of data monthly or a $25 plan for 2 gigabytes of data. Customers to date have bought 60 percent of their Verizon iPhones online, rather than in stores, Shammo said at the conference in San Francisco. He didn’t give details on the number of units sold or on the planned tiered data-pricing plans. Later this month, Verizon will begin sales of the iPhone in smaller retailers and other storefronts. Today it is available primarily online, in Verizon and Apple stores and at the largest retailers, such as Best Buy Co. Verizon Communications, based in New York, fell 90 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $36.02 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Apple, based in Cupertino, California , lost $3.90, or 1.1 percent, to $349.31 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

{"headline": "Iran Says EU Ban Will Boost Oil Prices, Hurt West’s Growth", "article": "The European Union’s ban on imports of Iranian crude will drive up oil prices and aggravate market instability, the Islamic Republic said in comments that were contradicted by some analysts. The decision by EU foreign ministers to phase out purchases of Iranian oil from July was “hasty” and may lead to “heavy economic loss and damages to the crisis-stricken people of Europe,” the Iranian oil ministry said in a statement on state- run Fars news agency late yesterday. Iran ’s foreign ministry said the decision “would bear bitter fruit.” The EU ban is part of efforts by the bloc and the U.S. to pressure the Persian Gulf state over a nuclear program that Western nations say is aimed at producing weapons. Iran says the program is for civilian energy and medical purposes. The EU measures include freezing assets of the Iranian central bank in Europe and banning trade in petrochemicals from Iran. “They were rattled by the EU actions and their ability to reach a clear consensus, so these statements seem like more bluster to reassure a domestic audience,” Robin Mills, an analyst at Manaar Energy Consulting in Dubai, said today. Crude gained since the middle of last month, partly because of concern that Iran may close the Strait of Hormuz , the passage for about 20 percent of the world’s oil. The risk of disruption is already included in prices, adding $10 a barrel this month, said Ole Hansen, trading advisory manager at Saxo Bank A/S. The Iranian ministry’s comments may point to an easing in tension between the West and Iran as the Islamic Republic may seek alternative customers before the EU embargo comes into effect, said Mills, who worked on Iran for a decade with Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Alternative Buyers “If they are able to find buyers without having to offer too much in the way of discounts, they won’t have much of a problem with the embargo come June,” Mills said by telephone. Crude futures closed yesterday at 99.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That’s less than the closing level on Dec. 27, when Iran threatened to blockade shipments from the Persian Gulf. Increased output from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries such as Libya (OPCRLIBY) may make up for a decline in Iranian crude supply, Oswald Clint , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a note today. Brent crude may trade from $100 to $120 a barrel if other producers make up any fall in Iran’s exports, according to Bernstein. Brent futures were trading at about $110 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London today. Yield to Pressure “The Iranian nation has many times proved that it would never yield to pressure and unjust moves, aimed at abandoning its legitimate and legal rights,” the foreign ministry said in its statement. “Any confrontation move against the independence and advancement of the independent countries would lead to further complication of the present day world crises,” it said. Iran has “no concerns whatsoever for finding new customers” for its crude, according to the oil ministry’s statement. Europe, collectively the second-biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China , imported 450,000 barrels a day of the nation’s crude in the first half of last year, U.S. Energy Department data show.

{"headline": "U.S. Said to Open Criminal Probe of FX Market Rigging", "article": "The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, a person familiar with the matter said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation , which is also looking into alleged rigging of interest rates associated with the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is in the early stages of its currency market probe, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the inquiry is confidential. The U.S. investigation comes as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said in June it was reviewing potential manipulation of exchange rates. That month, allegations that dealers at banks pooled information through instant messages and used client orders to move benchmark currency rates were reported by Bloomberg News. Regulators are probing the alleged abuse of financial benchmarks used in markets from oil to interest rate swaps by the firms that play a central role in setting them. Swiss regulators said last week they were “coordinating closely with authorities in other countries as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated.” The probes include alleged manipulation of ISDAfix, a benchmark in the $379 trillion market for interest-rate swaps. The International Organization of Securities Commissions, the Madrid-based group representing regulators from more than 100 countries, set tougher guidelines for publishing benchmarks in a July 17 report, including making prices based on “observable” deals where possible to increase transparency. Commodities Markets Regulators, including European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia , may examine commodities markets, having already increased investigations of manipulation of benchmarks for oil, interest rates, derivatives and foreign exchange. EU investigators searched the offices of Platts, the unit of New York-based McGraw Hill Financial Inc. that assesses the price of Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of the world’s crude. Kathleen Tanzy, a New York-based spokeswoman for Platts, said in an Oct. 4 e-mailed statement that the company’s “aim is to bring transparency to price discovery by publishing as much detailed and meaningful information as possible.” In a Bloomberg News survey conducted over eight weeks, commodities traders who buy and sell as much as $5.67 trillion of raw materials a year say the benchmark prices for everything from oil to iron ore to gasoline are wrong as often as 27 percent of the time. The person familiar with the U.S. currency market probe didn’t say which banks may be under scrutiny. Peter Carr , a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, declined to comment on the investigation. Antitrust Regulators Probes of Libor manipulation led to fines totaling about $2.6 billion against four firms, including UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland ’s largest bank, for rigging the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide. Earlier this week, European Union antitrust regulators said they were examining the possible manipulation of currency rates by the financial industry, while Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, and the nation’s competition commission said they were probing similar potential wrongdoing. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been reviewing possible currency market rigging, said a separate person with knowledge of the matter. The U.K.’s FCA sent requests for information to four banks, including Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C) , a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified said in June. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc has handed over records of instant messages to the FCA after concluding a former currency trader’s communications with counterparts at other firms may have been inappropriate, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Reviewing E-Mails RBS, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup are among firms reviewing e-mails, instant messages and phone records of their foreign-exchange employees for evidence of potential manipulation, according to three people with knowledge of those probes. Spokesmen at all the firms have previously declined to comment. Seb Howell, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, Jeffrey French , a spokesman for Citigroup, and Jason Knauf, a spokesman for RBS, declined to comment on the U.S. investigation. RBS, in its deferred prosecution agreement over Libor manipulation with the U.S. in February, agreed to cooperate in “any and all matters” related to “manipulation, attempted manipulation, or interbank coordination of benchmark rate submissions.” Prosecutors filed a nonpublic document in that case listing the rates that are the focus of its ongoing investigation, according to court records. German Regulator Germany ’s financial regulator said it sees no reason for a special audit of any of the country’s banks for potential currency manipulation, Ben Fischer , a spokesman for Bafin, said earlier this week. FTSE Group , the compiler of Britain’s FTSE 100, is reviewing the currency benchmarks it uses to value its global stock indexes, said three people with knowledge of the plan. The index provider, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , is setting up a working group to examine its use of the WM/Reuters foreign exchange rates, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t allowed to talk publicly. The review, at an early stage, will probably focus on proposing changes to the way WM/Reuters calculates the figure rather than on whether to stop using it, one of the people said. Currencies WM/Reuters rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half-hourly for the 21 most-traded. They are the median of all trades in a minute-long period starting 30 seconds before the beginning of each half-hour. Rates for less-widely traded currencies are based on quotes during a two-minute window. The data are collected and distributed by World Markets Co., a unit of Boston-based State Street Corp. (STT) , and Thomson Reuters Corp. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news and information as well as currency-trading systems.

The company raised its fourth-quarter forecast. Profit excluding some costs rose to $49.5 million, or 52 cents a share, from $49.2 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Take-Two said in a statement. That exceeded the 34-cent average of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company had forecast profit of 25 cents to 35 cents a share on that basis. Sales fell 7.2 percent to $334.3 million, beating analysts’ estimates of $312.6 million. “We will have a lot of work to do,” Take-Two Chief Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick said in an interview. “That said, I think the release schedule looks great.” Take-Two jumped as much as 6.6 percent to $15.50 in late trading after the results were announced. The shares advanced 19 cents to $14.54 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, their highest price since October 2008, and have gained 19 percent this year. Take-Two, based in New York, may be reversing a history of annual losses by building a strong portfolio of company-owned games, Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee in Dallas , said in a Feb. 3 note to investors. He has a “buy” rating on the shares. “Our sum-of-the-parts valuation yields values in the $17- plus range and is based on the company’s strong game portfolio,” including “L.A. Noire” and “Agent,” Bhatia wrote. New Releases “L.A. Noire” is slated for May 17 release. Take-Two hasn’t said when it will release “Agent,” an espionage game announced in June 2009. Take-Two’s 2K Sports division shipped more than 4 million units of its “NBA 2K11” game worldwide over the holiday period, according to the statement. The company said it also continues to benefit from add-on packs for its “Red Dead Redemption” Western shooter, which shipped more than 8 million copies since its May 2010 release. For the current quarter, Take-Two forecast a loss of 40 cents to 45 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $130 million to $150 million. That compares to an estimated loss of 51 cents a share on revenue of $136.3 million, according to 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

SEB ImmoInvest, the largest of 13 German real-estate funds that suspended redemptions after the global financial crisis, will re-open for one day on May 7 to take requests. It will liquidate if it doesn’t have enough cash to cover all orders, SEB Asset Management CEO said at a press conference today in Frankfurt. The fund has been closed for almost two years. Knoflach said she’s optimistic the fund won’t have to liquidate. ImmoInvest has “considerably” more than 30 percent of its assets in cash or equivalents, after selling properties she said. Germany’s 85.2 billion-euro real estate mutual fund industry may be facing its biggest crisis. Following the global recession that ended in 2009, funds struggled to meet redemption requests. As a result, 13 funds were frozen over the course of two years. Of those, six funds are liquidating, and several more, including funds owned by Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG, face deadlines this year to reopen or liquidate, according to Germany ’s financial trade group, Bundesverband Investment und Asset Management, or BVI. SEB, which proposed the one-day reopening with approval from German financial regulator BaFin, said it would allow withdrawals only once a year, instead of daily, if the fund continues after May 7. More than 90 percent of the fund’s customers are small private investors, according to Knoflach. The strategy “will fail,” said Bjoern Drescher, chief executive of Drescher Cie, a consulting firm near Bonn. “It’s herd psychology. I don’t think investors will heed her appeal.” ImmoInvest owns buildings in Paris, Singapore , Rome as well as 19 buildings on Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz.

{"headline": "Canadian Dollar Weakens to Three-Month Low on Growth Concern", "article": "The Canadian dollar weakened to the lowest level against the greenback since August on concern that budget gridlock in the U.S. and Europe’s unresolved sovereign- debt crisis will weigh on demand for the nation’s exports. The loonie, as the dollar is nicknamed for the image of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, traded in the narrowest range this week since March. Statistics Canada is forecast to report on Nov. 23 that the rise in consumer prices slowed in October from the prior month, suggesting Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney doesn’t need to emphasize raising interest rates. “There’s already risk impairment that’s embedded in the marketplace right now, which is having an adverse effect on the Canadian dollar,” Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank of Canada in Toronto, said in a phone interview. “Every other country is effectively going through the same scenario, so we’re not an outlier.” The Canadian currency weakened to as low as C$1.0057 yesterday, the least since Aug. 3, and was little changed on the week at C$1.0012, after trading between C$1.0057 and 99.85 U.S. cents. One Canadian dollar buys 99.88 U.S. cents. The loonie touched its more than three-month low as Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he’ll delay plans to balance the budget and run larger-than-expected deficits because global turmoil risks slowing growth in the world’s 11th largest economy. Global Outlook The 17 nation euro-area economy slipped into a recession for the second time in four years as governments imposed tougher budget cuts and leaders struggled to contain the debt crisis that broke out in October 2009. Gross domestic product slipped 0.1 percent in the third quarter after a 0.2 percent decline in the previous three months, the European Union’s statistics office said this week. House Speaker John Boehner said he offered a “framework” including new revenue to reduce the U.S. budget deficit in his first face-to-face talks yesterday with President Barack Obama and top Congress leaders since the Nov. 6 election. “The fiscal cliff has dominated the market,” Benjamin Reitzes , senior economist and vice president economic research in Toronto at BMO Capital Markets, said at a telephone interview. “This is going to persist and be a weight on risk sentiment, stocks, and the Canadian dollar. That won’t change until there’s more clarity on that front.” The $607 billion fiscal cliff is a combination of tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in January if Congress doesn’t act. Lawmakers of both parties want to avoid a short-term shock to the economy while making progress on long- term deficit reduction. International Demand Canadian government bonds rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year security falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.69 percent this week. The price of the 2.75 percent bond maturing in June 2022 rose 18 cents to C$109.27. Foreign net purchases of Canadian securities almost doubled in September from the month before on government bond sales, the federal statistics agency said. Purchases totaled C$13.9 billion ($13.9 billion) in September and the estimated August purchase was increased to C$7.56 billion from an initial C$6.90 billion. The consumer price index rose 1.2 percent in October from a year ago, according to the median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank’s preferred core rate probably slowed to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent in September, according to the survey. Moving Averages Carney has kept his key lending rate at 1 percent for more than two years and will probably leave it unchanged again at the Dec. 4 decision, according to a Bloomberg economist survey. The Canadian currency weakened past its 50-day, 100- and 200-day moving averages this week for the first time since July 25. The averages, momentum indicators, are seen by some traders as a turning point in the direction of a currency’s price. They’re calculated by adding closing prices for a specific number of assessment days, then dividing by that number. “This week the U.S. dollar-loonie cross failed to make any meaningful gains above 1.0040,” and “continues to trade within a relatively narrow range around its two-hundred day moving average,” Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said in a note to clients.

Today, a House subcommittee asked why the program, paid for by fees charged to U.S. phone subscribers, tripled in cost since 2008. “It’s not fair that people save and work and pay for phones from whatever funds they have, and other people get them for free,” Representative Tim Griffin, an Arkansas Republican who wants to eliminate the mobile subsidy, said in an interview before the hearing. “It’s not fair the biggest beneficiary of this is Carlos Slim , the billionaire owner of TracFone.” Slim owns Mexico ’s biggest phone company, America Movil SAB (AMXL) , which offers mobile service in 17 Latin American countries and the U.S. Its TracFone unit is the largest recipient under the U.S. Federal Communication Commission’s Lifeline program, taking in $451.7 million, or 28 percent, of payments in 2011, the last year for which records are available. “It doesn’t matter who owns the company,” Jose Fuentes, a spokesman for Miami-based TracFone, said in an interview. “Tim Griffin needs to focus on finding jobs, not trying to focus on a valuable program.” ‘Obama Phone’ The Lifeline program subsidizes monthly service, and carriers give away phones. Recipients generally can’t earn more than 135 percent of the federal poverty line , which in most states is $23,550 for a family of four. Rules limiting phones to one per household may be violated in some cases, Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said today. “We are spending large sums of money and probably squandering much of it,” Walden said. The program has seen “explosive growth,” said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, at the hearing. “It’s why so many of our constituents are questioning the program and are questioning the use of the ’Obama phones’ as they are commonly called.” Started in 1985, Lifeline pays companies $9.25 per customer per month. It disbursed $772 million in 2008 and $2.2 billion last year, according to the Universal Service Administrative Co., a Washington-based nonprofit that oversees the subsidies. TracFone is the largest prepaid wireless company in the U.S., with 23.2 million customers at the end of March and $4.8 billion in revenue last year. Lifeline accounts for about 3.6 million of those customers, Fuentes said. Program Trimmed Largest U.S. telephone company AT&T Inc. (T) took in $274.9 million and third-largest wireless provider Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , based in Overland Park , Kansas , received $273.5 million, according to the FCC. AT&T’s share includes aid for wired phone customers. The FCC last year moved to trim the Lifeline program. The agency voted to set up a database of participants, which is under construction, to prevent households from collecting more than one subsidized phone service from different companies. The FCC also told carriers to check eligibility of customers annually, which can be shown through enrollment in social assistance programs. Verifying Eligibility The number of program participants has dropped, from 18.2 million to 13.2 million, as the FCC has revamped the program, said Representative Anna Eshoo of California , the top Democrat on the subcommittee. “What we need to stay away from, with all due respect, is simply a disdain for the president and then moving that to apply to policies in telecommunications -- I mean, it just doesn’t mix,” Eshoo said. “It doesn’t make sense; it’s not dignified. I don’t want to have anything to do with that.” Sprint in January told the FCC it couldn’t verify the continued eligibility of 1.6 million customers, or 44 percent of its Lifeline participants. Dallas-based AT&T said it dropped 47 percent of its customers, or 609,900 people, and TracFone said it couldn’t verify 739,500, or 19 percent, of its customers. People could drop from the rolls for not responding to a carrier’s query or if they earn more money. John Taylor , a Sprint spokesman, declined to comment. Until recent changes, FCC rules restricted AT&T from dropping customers with traditional wired phones from the program, Robert Quinn , senior vice president regulatory and chief privacy officer, said in an e-mail. ’Waste, Abuse’ The House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology’s hearing was called “in response to the growth, waste and abuse that has occurred,” Representative Fred Upton , a Michigan Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Walden said in a March 26 letter to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski. Representative John Shimkus , an Illinois Republican, said program supporters don’t seem to “understand the anger that’s out there in America over this.” Griffin, the Arkansas lawmaker, isn’t on the subcommittee and his bill isn’t slated to receive a vote during the session. The measure has attracted 42 supporters, all Republicans. It calls for eliminating the wireless subsidy. Payments could continue for wired telephones so households retain the ability to communicate, Griffin said. Wireless Perspective Regulators shouldn’t cut mobile service from the program because communications increasingly is moving to wireless devices and assistance should be neutral as to technology, Christopher Guttman-McCabe, vice president of regulatory affairs at CTIA-The Wireless Association, said in testimony submitted to the panel. The trade group based in Washington includes as members largest U.S. mobile carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile USA Inc. The NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in letters April 23 to Walden and Eshoo said Lifeline should continue to support wireless and traditional wire-based phones. The name “Obama Phone” was popularized during the 2012 elections as a video of an excited Cleveland woman extolling the program went viral on the Web. Critics have seized on the misnomer, even though the program was begun under President Ronald Reagan and a Republican FCC chairman in 2005 changed the program to admit new carriers such as TracFone that are driving program growth. “People say, ‘Well everybody needs a cellphone,’” Griffin said. “Well, what does ’need’ mean? Do you need an iPad? How about a computer? A printer?” To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bernard Kohn at bkohn2@bloomberg.net", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "미국 Lifeline 프로그램의 목적과 지원 대상은 누구인가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "mid", "question": "Lifeline 프로그램의 비용 증가와 관련된 주요 이슈는 무엇이며, 이에 대한 규제 기관의 대응은 어떠한가?"}, {"reasoning_effort": "high", "question": "Lifeline 프로그램의 무선 전화 보조금 폐지가 기업 가치, 리스크 프로파일, 이해관계자의 이해득실에 어떤 영향을 미칠 수 있는가?"}]}
{"headline": "Packed Congress Calendar Topped by Syria Crowds Out Bills", "article": "A new U.S. immigration law at one time looked like the main thing Congress could get done this year. Syria is crippling its chances. The debates over U.S. military involvement in Syria and federal government spending are crowding an already-packed congressional calendar, leaving little time or energy for revising the nation’s immigration laws, changing the tax code, passing a voting rights bill or stabilizing a money-losing U.S. Postal Service. Congress returns today from a five-week break. “Everything else is on the back burner,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma , a member of Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s leadership team. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican working on an immigration policy revision, said there was a 5 percent chance an immigration bill would pass by year’s end. He said he was optimistic because in previous years the chances were zero. If Congress doesn’t pass immigration legislation this year, it becomes more difficult in 2014 as lawmakers focus on their re-election campaigns, Diaz-Balart said. “Running out of time is a real issue,” Diaz-Balart, a House Appropriations Committee member, said in an interview. “Nothing is impossible but it gets a heck of a lot more difficult if we don’t get it done this year.” Time is short, even for the must-do fiscal items and the Syria vote. Lawmakers have three weeks until the government shuts down without a spending plan and less than two months to raise the debt limit or risk a U.S. default. Vote Planned First up is Syria, with a vote in the Senate planned this week. The House will consider legislation this week to extend current spending levels for the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Days when both chambers are working in the next two months are limited. The House, scheduled to work just 10 weeks for the rest of year, has a five-day break starting Sept. 23. The Senate is in session until an Oct. 14-18 break. President Barack Obama asked Congress for a “prompt” vote on authorization for strikes, which the White House says would deter and degrade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons. The U.S. blamed Assad for an attack that killed more than 1,400 people, including women and children. The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons, saying elements of the opposition were responsible. Vote Count In the House, 26 members publicly support military action and 202 are opposed or leaning against the resolution as of Sept. 8, with 205 undeclared. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed, 22 members favor the measure, 26 are opposed and 52 are undeclared. Many lawmakers will attend their first classified briefings today and Obama will deliver an address to the nation on Syria at 9 p.m. tomorrow. That’s pushing the timetable back on revamping immigration policy, one of Obama’s legislative goals this session. The Senate passed its immigration bill in June while House leaders worked during their break to find consensus in a reluctant Republican majority. The House hasn’t proposed legislation to change U.S. immigration policy and is working on a piecemeal approach. The Republican National Committee recommended that the party reach out to minority voters after its presidential candidate, Mitt Romney , won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012. No Timetable An immigration revision’s biggest hurdle might be that it doesn’t have a timetable to force lawmakers into action. A Republican leadership aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed to the RNC report and suggested the only deadline is the 2016 presidential election. Money is the other top priority starting this week. In 2011, lawmakers fought for months over raising the nation’s debt limit. Stock investors were affected, with the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) falling 16.8 percent between July 22, when talks on a broad deal faltered, and Aug. 8, the first trading day after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating citing the partisan gridlock. Credit markets weren’t rattled by the 2011 standoff, as yields on 10-year Treasury notes declined to 2.61 percent on Aug. 2, 2011, from 3.18 percent the previous July 1, and continued to fall to 1.88 percent at year-end. Still, fiscal deadlines push lawmakers to act. ‘Wiggle Room’ “Votes have a way of forcing politicians to take a position and give up the wiggle room that is the bread and butter of politics,” said Tom Perriello, a former Democratic House member from Virginia. He is now president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a Washington research group founded by former aides to President Bill Clinton. “It’s easier to be on both sides of an issue.” A record 83 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Congress was doing, according to an NBC News poll released July 24. The survey of 1,000 adults had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said they would vote to replace every single member of Congress, including their own, if they could. That was the highest in at least three years, according to the poll results. “The American people are concerned about two main things: gridlock and doing important things,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told reporters before lawmakers started their recess on Aug. 2. “We have to overcome the gridlock of the Republicans and pass some important bills.” Republican View Republicans view the divide differently. They see a Democratic president refusing to negotiate on a debt ceiling, though he voted against raising the limit when he was a U.S. senator in 2006. At the time Obama said “raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.” A pair of Tea Party Republicans, Utah Senator Mike Lee and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, have gathered signatures from lawmakers who back defunding the president’s health-care law in return for passing a short-term spending bill. They’ve gained support from about-one third of the House and Senate Republicans, not enough to force the issue. Instead, Republicans will claim victory with a short-term spending resolution that maintains discretionary levels at $988 billion. If lawmakers can keep the government running, that would set up negotiations over the debt limit. Republicans see some leverage with across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, that began taking effect in March. Spending Reductions The spending reductions were set to be so intolerable that lawmakers of both parties would compromise on spending to avert $1.2 trillion in cuts over nine years. Instead, no accord was reached and the reductions began. As much as $85 billion will be withheld for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, forcing curtailed services and payroll cuts. “There’s a variety of things we could do that would allow us to both address at least part of the sequesters, which the president and Democrats in the Senate very much want to do,” Cole said in an interview. On the debt limit, Republicans will seek to define their price for agreeing to an increase, said Jonathan Traub, a managing principal at Deloitte Tax LLP in Washington. “It can’t be so big that it can’t pass,” he said, citing calls for repealing the 2010 health-care law. “But it can’t be so small that it’s meaningless.” Common ground might include expanded means-testing for Medicare and trimming Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustments, which Obama included in his budget proposal. Obama’s plan canceled the spending cuts and included $580 billion in revenue increases. There’s been little sign of negotiations since Congress left Washington. “Let me reiterate what our position is, and it is unequivocal,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Aug. 26. “We will not negotiate with Republicans in Congress over Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up, period.” To contact the reporter on this story: Michael C.

{"headline": "Biogen to Pay Elan $3.25 Billion for Full Tysabri Rights", "article": "Biogen Idec Inc. rose to its highest value ever after the drugmaker agreed to buy partner Elan Corp. ’s stake in the Tysabri multiple sclerosis medicine for $3.25 billion in cash plus future royalties. Biogen gained 2.3 percent to $160.98 at 4 p.m. New York time, its highest price since the company began trading in 1991. The shares of the Weston, Massachusetts-based drugmaker have gained 32 percent in the last 12 months. The agreement gives Biogen all rights to the product, the companies said in separate statements today, and leaves Dublin- based Elan to hunt for possible acquisitions with the proceeds. The companies had been splitting profit equally on Tysabri, which generated $1.6 billion in sales in 2012 and is Biogen’s second-best selling drug. “The deal puts Tysabri marketing rights 100 percent in Biogen hands and accordingly we see incremental medium- to long- term upside potential to revenues,” Ravi Mehrotra , an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote in a research note today, calling the purchase a “significant positive” for Biogen. He recommends buying Biogen shares. The move ends speculation that Biogen would buy Elan and transforms the Irish company into an investment vehicle in search of health-care assets. Elan’s experimental drug for Alzheimer’s disease failed in late-stage trials last year, leaving Tysabri as the company’s single major product. Elan’s Shares Elan’s American depositary receipts, each representing one ordinary share, declined 10 percent to $9.40, their biggest one- day decline since July 24. The stock’s drop may reflect selling by investors who had been speculating on an acquisition by Biogen, Corey Davis , an analyst with Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in an e-mail. Investors also may be skeptical that Elan can create more value through acquisitions than it would by repurchasing shares or paying dividends, said Richard Parkes of Deutsche Bank AG in London. “This move gives us a chance to reinvest a fair amount of capital across a whole host of assets and helps us redefine and reposition the whole company,” Elan Chief Executive Officer Kelly Martin said in an interview. The company seeks a “balanced portfolio of assets” that would include products already on the market and experimental medicines, he said. Under the terms of the deal, Biogen will pay Elan 12 percent of global net sales of Tysabri for the first year. After the first year, the payments will be 18 percent on annual sales of as much as $2 billion and 25 percent on sales of more than $2 billion. Elan has said Tysabri sales may reach $2.5 billion to $3 billion by 2016, Eric Schmidt , an analyst with Cowen & Co., wrote in a research note. He estimated $1.9 billion by 2017. Companies’ Advisers Centerview Partners LLC acted as exclusive financial adviser to Biogen, while Ropes & Gray LLP was legal counsel. Citigroup Inc. and Ondra Partners are acting as financial advisers to Elan, who had Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP and A&L Goodbody as legal counsels. Tysabri was left as Elan’s single major product after the experimental Alzheimer’s drug bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive or functional ability in patients in late-stage studies. Future actions will be guided by Elan’s “assessment of business opportunities,” Martin said in the statement. “We are enthusiastic about the market opportunities around the globe and remain flexible and creative about the manner in which we would participate in those opportunities.” Seeking Assets Elan isn’t in talks to sell the company and has been negotiating for months to acquire assets, Martin, 53, said in the interview. The first investment could happen shortly after the deal closes, he said. “Elan has no track record of running a fully integrated specialty pharma company, so a lot of uncertainty remains,” Guillaume van Renterghem , an analyst at UBS AG in London, said in a telephone interview. “Investors would probably appreciate getting their cash back instead of seeing the company diversify through the acquisition of assets.” He recommends buying Elan shares. Martin, a former Merrill Lynch & Co. investment banker who joined Elan in 2003, planned to leave the company by May 1 last year. The board asked him to stay until the bapineuzumab trial results, and once the drug failed, efforts to find a new CEO ended. After the failure, Elan said it wouldn’t discourage suitors that approached it about an acquisition, and announced the spinoff of its drug discovery unit into a company called Prothena Corp., completed in December. Earnings Impact Elan didn’t consider winding down the company and returning the proceeds to shareholders, Martin told reporters today. He said he plans to stay involved as the Tysabri deal closes and as the company reviews possible acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Elan plans to return a portion of the capital to shareholders though the amount and timing would depend on investment opportunities, he said. The $3.25 billion in cash that Biogen will pay equals more than half of Elan’s $6.23 billion market value. For Biogen, purchasing full control of Tysabri will add about 20 cents to 30 cents a share to 2013 earnings , or 50 cents to 60 cents when adjusted for some items, the company said in a statement. Biogen said it anticipates the deal will continue to add to profit depending on how well Tysabri sells. The purchase has been approved by both companies’ boards and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, Biogen said. Next Step “This is a natural next step for Biogen Idec and Tysabri, and it underscores our deep, long-term commitment to improving the lives of MS patients around the world,” Biogen Chief Executive Officer George Scangos said in the statement. “Full ownership will improve our ability to navigate its role as part of our leadership in MS.” Tysabri is Biogen ’s second-best-seller after the MS medicine Avonex. The company also is awaiting regulatory approval for another drug for MS, BG-12, now known as Tecfidera. “Biogen has three sales forces, one for each product,” Credit Suisse’s Mehrotra wrote today. “However, over time, we see an obvious consolidation into one sales force with a central message that could effectively state, ‘We are THE MS Company. What approach to treatment would you or your patient like? We have the best drug in each segment.”’ Biogen told analysts in response to questions on a conference call today that it had no current plans to reorganize its sales strategy, though it wouldn’t rule out future changes. Biogen also said it plans to open a $500 million to $750 million line of credit to fund working capital needs. The company had $3.7 billion in cash , equivalents and marketable securities at the end of 2012, according to a Jan. 28 statement. Tysabri is a once-monthly infusion for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects more than 2.1 million people worldwide, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Higher Efficacy The drug has shown higher efficacy in staving off the neurological attacks that characterize relapsing MS. It is generally recommended for patients who have already tried other therapies because it’s associated with a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML. Biogen has developed a test to help determine patients’ risk. Biogen also is testing Tysabri in secondary-progressive MS, a form of the disease that follows relapsing-remitting in which the disease progresses more steadily. The drug is in the third and final stage of clinical trials generally required for approval, with data expected in 2015.
