{"headline": "Marriott Cuts Profit Forecast as Demand Weakens Overseas", "article": "Marriott International Inc. (MAR) , the largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, cut its full-year profit forecast after reporting second-quarter results that were in line with analysts’ estimates. The company expects earnings per share for the third quarter of 42 cents to 46 cents, less than the 49-cent average of 29 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Marriott projected full-year earnings of $1.92 to $2.03 a share, which would miss both the $2.04 that analysts are estimating and the company’s own previous guidance of $1.93 to $2.08. Slowing demand from business groups and U.S. government cutbacks in travel spending weighed on Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott’s second-quarter earnings, while weakening hotel use abroad may hamper results for the rest of the year, according to Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson. “Looking at group business, we remain encouraged in terms of long-term bookings, but short-term group business weakened in the U.S. as the quarter progressed,” Sorenson said on a conference call with investors. “Our large convention hotels and our hotels in Washington and Boston were particularly impacted as group demand weakened.” The company is “still experiencing a lingering effect from the recession” and is taking a “more conservative view” of demand trends for Asia and the Middle East, Sorensen said. Revpar Growth Second-quarter earnings of 57 cents a share matched the average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose to $179 million from $143 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement. Revenue per available room, an industry measure of occupancies and rates, climbed 5.3 percent from a year earlier at company-operated hotels in North America. Worldwide, revpar increased 4.7 percent, according to the statement. Marriott in May projected second-quarter earnings of 55 cents to 59 cents a share and said it expected revpar to increase 5 percent to 7 percent in North America, 2 percent to 4 percent outside North America and 4 percent to 6 percent worldwide. “International revenue growth has been quite tepid,” Nikhil Bhalla, an analyst at FBR & Co. (FBRC) in Arlington, Virginia, said after the earnings were announced. “Softening demand in Europe and Asia will weigh on them for the remainder of the year.” Total revenue rose to $3.26 billion in the second quarter from $2.78 billion a year earlier. Starwood, Hyatt Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) , owner of the luxury St. Regis and W brands, last week said second-quarter earnings climbed 12 percent, helped by cost cuts and sales of vacation units at the company’s South Florida resort. Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain controlled by the Pritzker family, yesterday said its second-quarter profit almost tripled as demand climbed at its U.S. properties. Marriott rose 0.2 percent to $41.58 in New York trading.

{"headline": "Sulfurcell Seeks Strategic Partner to Increase Solar Capacity", "article": "Sulfurcell Solartechnik GmbH , a Berlin-based manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, is seeking a strategic partner to help it expand production capacity by more than seven-fold. The company has raised 150 million euros ($205 million), including about 30 million euros in government incentives, Kalman Kaufman, chairman of the supervisory board, said in a Tel Aviv interview at a Landmark Ventures business conference yesterday. “To be really efficient you need hundreds of megawatts,” Kaufman said. A potential partner can be found \"probably in the Far East where the cost of labor is lower and there is more capital in this area.’’ Sulfurcell is planning to expand to between 200 and 300 megawatts of annual production from 40 megawatts in 2011, he said. About 1,700 megawatts in thin-film panels were produced in 2010, a majority of which were by U.S. manufacturer First Solar Inc ., Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated. Thin-film, developed as a cheaper alternative to the traditional solar panels from silicon, uses photovoltaic materials that are deposited in sheets onto surfaces such as for roof shingles or building blocks.

{"headline": "Solvay Second-Quarter Profit Tops Estimates as Prices Gain", "article": "Solvay SA (SOLB) , the world’s largest soda- ash maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates as price increases and rising demand for some products compensated for higher energy costs. Net income more than doubled to 111 million euros ($160 million) from 44 million euros a year earlier, the Brussels- based company said today in a statement. Profit topped the 100.3 million-euro average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Solvay said it raised prices for products including soda ash, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride and specialty polymers by 11 percent. The volume sold increased 4 percent after Solvay removed bottlenecks to expand production capacity for specialty polymers. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and special items rose 12 percent to 304 million euros and were unchanged as a proportion of revenue, at 18 percent. The manufacturer confirmed the earnings figures after highlights of a statement scheduled to be published July 28 were accidentally posted on Solvay’s website at 3:27 p.m. local time and subsequently removed. The soda-ash maker will publish full earnings as planned before the start of trading on July 28.

The company is “keen to assess Panmure Gordon’s upcoming trading results before determining whether there is any merit in taking its deliberations further,” London-based Evolution said in a statement today. “No formal discussions have taken place between management of the company and Panmure Gordon.” U.K. brokers are seeking to consolidate after the credit crisis cut off financing for takeovers, hurting revenue from advising on fundraisings and mergers. Panmure, which has about 64 corporate clients, said in March its net loss shrank to 11.1 million pounds ($17.4 million) in 2009. A purchase would follow broker Execution Holdings Ltd.’s December takeover of Noble Group Holdings Ltd. Panmure Gordon said in a separate statement that it hasn’t held talks with Evolution. The broker also said the first half “represented particularly challenging markets” though it “expects a bias in revenues towards the second half.” Panmure Gordon gained 8.6 percent to 31.5 pence in London, giving it a market value of about 45.7 million pounds ($71.8 million).

{"headline": "Saudi Banks Among World’s Most Profitable on Prudent Strategies", "article": "Saudi Arabia ’s commercial banking industry continues to be one of the world’s most profitable as high oil prices and vast government spending help lenders pursue prudent strategies, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services said. “Through a unique combination of supportive features, the Saudi banks we rate continue to demonstrate their ability to generate solid, sustainable core earnings, in turn fuelling high profits,” analyst Nicolas Hardy said in an e-mailed statement today. “Prospects for sound earnings and profits are bright.” Saudi bank lending had slowed in the previous two years after two family-owned businesses defaulted on at least $15.7 billion of loans and the economy was hurt by the global credit crunch. High oil prices and vast spending plans under the aegis of the Saudi government have driven the banks’ performance, along with low cost of funding, good pricing power high efficiency and a tax-free environment, according to the statement.

{"headline": "VW Brings Phaeton Flop Back to U.S. as Passat Sedan Fades", "article": "Volkswagen AG (VOW) plans to bring back the Phaeton luxury sedan to the U.S. as the carmaker looks to reignite flagging growth in one of the few markets it has been unable to crack. The Phaeton, the brand’s most expensive model, could be shown to U.S. consumers in January as VW prepares the car’s return after pulling it seven years ago because of weak sales. The reintroduction, which would complement the rollout of new sport-utility vehicles, is aimed at showing off VW’s engineering prowess as the lift from the mainstream Passat sedan fades. “A brand as large as Volkswagen needs a halo project in the upscale segment,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn told Bloomberg at a conference in the company’s hometown of Wolfsburg earlier this month, confirming that the Phaeton will return to U.S. showrooms. “We’ve seen what happens to brands that don’t have that kind of project.” The Phaeton, a pet project of VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech , last year sold about half the volume worldwide that the company initially targeted. Its U.S. comeback is part of a plan to spend $5 billion over the next three years to roll out new models and boost sales in the U.S., where deliveries have started to slip after a two-year burst following the 2011 rollout of the Passat and Jetta sedans that were redesigned for American tastes. Audi Underpinnings The Crossblue concept, a seven-seat sport-utility vehicle that would compete with the Ford (F) Explorer and Toyota Highlander, was shown at the Detroit car show this year. It’s intended to be a big seller alongside the Tennessee-made Passat. The U.S. push is critical to VW’s strategy to surpass General Motors Co. (GM) and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) in global deliveries by 2018. A new version of the Phaeton may be presented at the Detroit auto show in January to test the response for an eventual rollout, three people familiar with the matter said. The car would share underpinnings with the Audi A8 sedan and a hybrid version is planned, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. At its current pace, the company will come up well short of its target of selling 800,000 vehicles in the U.S. by 2018. IHS Automotive predicts deliveries of 517,000 vehicles to American consumers in five years, missing the target by 35 percent. The company has been losing ground this year. VW’s sales in the U.S. fell 0.9 percent to 206,792 cars in the first six months of 2013, while total light vehicle sales in the country rose 7.7 percent. ‘Give Gas’ Volkswagen shares rose 1.4 percent to 169.65 euros today in Frankfurt trading. The gain trimmed the stock’s decline to 1.5 percent this year, valuing the company at 77 billion euros. The Jetta, Beetle and Passat models, which fueled VW’s gains over the past two years, “reached maturity in terms of their sales cycles,” said Tim Urquhart, a London-based analyst at IHS Automotive. The Crossblue SUV should revive growth, while the Phaeton may offer little help, he said. To reinvigorate growth, CEO Winterkorn traveled to Washington last week to show off new models to more than 500 dealers and “motivate them to give gas again,” the executive said. Still, the return of the Phaeton could jar Volkswagen’s recent U.S. strategy of appealing to mid-market buyers. The company made the Passat bigger and cheaper than the European version to appeal to U.S. drivers. The Phaeton started at $66,700 before VW withdrew it. In Germany , the car starts at 70,000 euros ($92,100). Those prices would likely mean the Phaeton would cost more than Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Equus, which starts at $59,250. It could also rival the $75,100 A8 from VW’s Audi unit. Piech Project The return of the Phaeton “would be a bad decision,” said Jesse Toprak , an analyst for TrueCar Inc., which tracks U.S. auto sales. “No one spends $80,000 on a Volkswagen. The company already has luxury brands that can cater to that segment,” such as Audi. The 2006 withdrawal of the Phaeton from the world’s largest market for upscale vehicles was a move by Wolfgang Bernhard , the head of the VW brand at the time, to stem losses in the region. The decision helped trigger his departure because the move called into question Chairman Piech’s strategy. The Phaeton was started by Piech while he was CEO, including the construction of a $238 million glass-walled factory in Dresden. The plant has become one of the city’s top tourist sites alongside the Semperoper opera house, attracting about 90,000 visitors a year. White Robes Production areas have parquet floors with workers wearing white robes -- sometimes even white gloves -- as they assemble cars by hand. The factory’s most eye-catching building is a 40-meter (131-foot) glass tower where finished Phaetons are parked prior to delivery. VW has already sought to reintroduce the Phaeton to the U.S. public. In May, the New York Philharmonic played a concert at the Dresden factory. A raw body frame of a Phaeton dangled above the stage, the gray aluminum illuminated by a soft blue light. The performance featured percussionists clanging 43 body parts of the car as part of a special arrangement of Finnish composer Magnus Lindberg’s Kraft (German for “power”). In the U.S., VW’s narrow lineup has cost it customers like David Smith. The former Golf and Jetta driver wanted a bigger car for his teenage son and two dogs and opted for Toyota Highlander in 2011 after considering VW’s Routan minivan. He’s in the market for a second car and would switch back to VW if the brand had the right car. The Phaeton might be stretching it. “When I was a kid, VW was always an affordable car, and that’s what it should be,” he said.

{"headline": "Strengthen Your Workforce Through Volunteer Programs", "article": "Time-crunched employees are increasingly looking to their jobs to provide opportunities for the good deeds that they don't have the hours for outside of work, and companies are responding. But karmic satisfaction is only part of the payoff. Volunteering offers participants the opportunity to strengthen their skills, broaden their networks, break out of a career rut, and find new meaning in their job. All these benefits redound to employers in the form of increased engagement and retention. Data from the Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) shows that the vast majority of college graduates want to amplify their commitment to good causes through their employer. According to the Deloitte Volunteer Impact Survey (PDF) , Generation Ys who frequently participate in their company's volunteer activities are more likely to be very proud to work for their company, feel very loyal, and are very satisfied with the progression of their careers. In fact, for many recent college graduates, a robust corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandate makes a crucial difference in where they choose to work, with 77% of respondents in a recent study (PDF) indicating that \"a company's commitment to social issues is important when I decide where to work.\" These sentiments hold true across generational cohorts. CTI data finds that 91% of Gen X women and 76% of Gen X men , and 90% of female and 79% of male Baby Boomers , feel it is important to contribute to their community or the wider world through work. Corporate volunteer programs range from one-day community service activities to mini-sabbaticals that send top performers to developing countries to lend their expertise to nonprofit organizations and proven entrepreneurs. Moody's Afternoon of Service is a good example of a once-a-year opportunity for people who want to dip their toes into volunteering. The program takes place during the workday; employees sign up for a variety of team-based activities, including sorting library books at a public school in a poor neighborhood, planting flower bulbs in a city park, lending a hand at an organization that gathers clothing for and coaches disadvantaged women going out on job interviews, and preparing lunch at a community soup kitchen. Fran Laserson, President of the Moody's Foundation, remembers the overwhelming response to this program, which was launched in 2008. \"We're a quantitatively focused company,\" she says. \"Our culture is not effusive or emotional. This is a group of people who rarely say 'very,' yet close to 100% said they found the activity to be rewarding or very rewarding.\" And 67% built relationships with colleagues they didn't usually work with. After the event, 51% felt better about the company, and 50% felt better about themselves. Originally offered to just a few departments, the program is now company-wide, with more than half of all employees participating in 2011. For people who crave a bigger challenge, at least 27 Fortune 500 companies — including Dow Corning, Intel, PepsiCo, FedEx, IBM, and Pfizer — now operate pro bono programs in emerging economies such as India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Ghana, according to a survey by CDC Development Solutions. Such initiatives give employees a chance to develop new skills, the company an opportunity to scope out new business in emerging markets, and the local organization the benefits of corporate expertise and relationships. (By the way, although referred to as \"volunteer\" posts, employees usually receive their regular salaries during their stints of service.) Ernst & Young, for example, sends participants in its Corporate Social Responsibility Fellows program to Central and South America for three months to do the same work they've been doing in their home offices but for much smaller companies. By helping local entrepreneurs with their most pressing business problems — typically providing help that they couldn't otherwise afford — Ernst & Young hopes to bolster their business and build relationships in these growing markets. Recent projects included developing a human resource strategy for a business in Uruguay that provides road accident prevention and risk management services, and organizing the financial records for a Chilean company that makes reusable shopping bags. Such volunteer assignments can do more than inject excitement into a humdrum job; they can ignite a career. Like being tapped for a high-potential development track, getting accepted for a volunteer stint is super-competitive — Intel, for example, says that only 5% of applicants win spots in its Education Service Corps. It's also high-profile, with blogs and videos of participants' experiences distributed throughout the company and on the internet. Who knows what kind of connections could result? In short, corporate volunteer programs deliver more than a karmic paycheck. By providing a practical bonus for both participants and employers, they're not just a \"nice to have\" perk but a retention tool, leadership development opportunity, and strategic business initiative.", "questions": [{"reasoning_effort": "low", "question": "기업 자원봉사 프로그램이 직원 유지율(retention)에 미치는 긍정적 영향은 무엇인가요?

{"headline": "Donald Payne, N.J.’s First Black Congressman, Dies at 77 of Colon Cancer", "article": "Donald Payne, New Jersey ’s first and so far only black congressman and a leading advocate for democracy in Africa during 23 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, has died. He was 77. He died today at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, of complications from colon cancer, his office said. The senior member of New Jersey’s House delegation, Payne represented the 10th congressional district, which includes parts of Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth, the state’s urban core across the Hudson River from New York City , as well as suburbs including Maplewood and Millburn. He was a longtime member of House committees that oversee education and foreign affairs, and a former chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on Africa. President Barack Obama , speaking at the end of a White House news conference, said Payne “was a wonderful man who did great work both domestically and internationally.” In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie planned to order flags lowered in honor of Payne, according to his spokesman, Michael Drewniak. “He was a great role model for every person in New Jersey who aspires to public service,” Christie said in a statement. “He was a true gentleman and we considered him a friend.” On one of his many trips to the African continent, a 2009 visit to Somalia after a U.S. advisory against Americans visiting there, Payne narrowly escaped a mortar attack in the capital, Mogadishu. Islamist insurgents took responsibility for the attack on the Mogadishu airport as Payne was leaving. Trip With Clinton An earlier trip to Africa was a 12-day tour with President Bill Clinton in 1998 to Ghana , Uganda , Rwanda , South Africa , Botswana and Senegal. Upon his return, Payne told the Associated Press that he hoped the coverage of the trip would give Americans a new awareness and appreciation of African countries that were making strides toward democracy. “The only images during the past decade have been those of strife, disease, conflict, dictators, children starving,” he said. “So for the first time, America had an opportunity to see a balanced picture of Africa.” In 2004, Congress passed a resolution introduced by Payne describing the killings in the Darfur region of Sudan as “genocide,” the first time Congress had applied the term to an ongoing massacre, the New Yorker magazine reported. Payne was a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , and he led the group’s nonprofit foundation. ‘Earned Respect’ House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the congressman “earned respect around the world for his outspoken advocacy on behalf of human rights and the worth and dignity of every person,” according to a statement released by her office. Payne faced little competition in his strongly Democratic district, winning his last general election, in 2010, with 85 percent of the vote. Those seeking to run for the seat left vacant by Payne’s death must register to run in the state’s primary election by the April 2 deadline, according to New Jersey’s Division of Elections. The primary is scheduled for June 5. Donald Milford Payne was born on July 16, 1934, in Newark to William Evander Payne and the former Norma Garrett, according to “Black Americans in Congress,” a House publication. They lived in the Doodletown neighborhood of the city’s predominantly Italian-American North Ward, according to a 1988 New York Times story. His father worked as a chauffeur for families in East Orange and as a lumber handler for Weyerhaeuser on the waterfront. ‘Sense of Neighborhood’ “Everyone, whites and blacks, worked for low wages, although we didn’t think of it as living in poverty, and there was a real sense of neighborhood, of depending on one another,” he told the Times. Payne earned a bachelor’s degree from Seton Hall University in neighboring South Orange in 1957 and married the former Hazel Johnson in 1958, according to the House publication. She died in 1963. He worked as a public-school teacher, an executive at Prudential Insurance Co. and vice president of Urban Data Systems Inc., both based in Newark. The latter company, where he was employed when he was elected to Congress, was started by his brother, William, and made computer forms, according to the Times. From 1970 to 1973 he served as the first black president of the National Council of YMCAs, and he was a member of the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1972 to 1978. From 1973 to 1981 he was chairman of the World YMCA Refugee and Rehabilitation Committee, a job that took him to 80 countries, according to the Times. He served on Newark’s city council from 1982 to 1988. Challenged Rodino In 1980 and 1986, Payne waged unsuccessful primary challenges to Newark’s longtime Democratic congressman, Peter Rodino. Known nationally as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon , Rodino retired in 1988. Payne ran for the seat that year and won. “Nothing is as powerful as a dream whose time has come,” he told the Times after the election. Payne and his wife had three children including Donald M. Payne Jr., president of the Newark Municipal Council.
